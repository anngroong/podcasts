# The Incoming Multipolar World and Where We Stand Today  

## The Ongoing conflicts: Gaza, Syria, Ukraine  
- **Gaza: Trump’s Shocking Statements on Ethnic Cleansing**  
  - Trump’s proposal to “take over” and redevelop Gaza as the “Riviera of the Middle East”  
  - The UN condemns the plan as illegal and warns of ethnic cleansing  
  - Regional implications: Would Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and others accept it?  
  - Does this align with Trump’s “America First” strategy?  

- **Syria: Turkey’s Strategic Moves**  
  - Former wanted terrorist Ahmed al-Sharaa (Abu Mohammad al-Julani) now rules Syria  
  - Turkey signs military alliance with Syria and establishes military bases  
  - Has Turkey successfully consolidated its control, or is it overextending?  
  - Potential consequences for Turkey’s broader regional ambitions, including the South Caucasus  

- **Ukraine: The War’s Endgame and Global Repercussions**  
  - Trump’s promise to end the war quickly—how realistic is it?  
  - Mixed signals: threats of new sanctions on Russia vs. demand that Ukraine provide rare earth resources as collateral  
  - UK’s unprecedented 100-year strategic deal with Ukraine, including military cooperation  
  - Why is this war seen as the defining moment for a transition to a new world order?
  
## Shifting Global Power and Alliances  

- **The West's Declining Influence & The Rise of Multipolarity**  
  - Marco Rubio’s statement: “It’s not normal for the world to simply have a unipolar power.”  
  - The shift away from the US acting as the world’s sole "police officer"  
  - The significance of Ukraine as the catalyst for a new global order  

- **China and Russia: A Strengthening Strategic Relationship**  
  - NATO’s post-Cold War expansion—did it push Russia toward China?  
  - Could the US have prevented this alliance by integrating Russia earlier?  
  - What does the China-Russia alliance mean for the future of global power?  

- **Multipolarity and Emerging Alliances**  
  - NATO as a military bloc vs. BRICS as an economic federation—two different models  
  - How BRICS is reshaping global financial systems and reducing reliance on the dollar  
  - Could NATO members (like Turkey) also become BRICS members, and what does that mean geopolitically?  

- **The Future of NATO in a Multipolar World**  
  - If military power is no longer the primary determinant of global influence, how must NATO evolve?  
  - As the US reduces its international military commitments, will European states step up?  
  - Are NATO’s member states truly aligned, or are internal fractures emerging?  
  - How will shifting alliances affect NATO’s relevance in the coming decades?  


## Small Countries in a Multipolar World  

- **The Role of Middle Powers & Small States**  
  - In a world divided between competing economic and military blocs, where do middle powers (Turkey, Iran, Indonesia, Brazil, etc.) fit?  
  - What role do smaller nations like Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Lebanon play?  

- **Survival Strategies for Small Countries in a Shifting Global Order**  
  - Can small states maintain strategic neutrality in a world where major powers are reconfiguring alliances?  
  - The importance of balancing relationships with the West, Russia, and China  
  - The risks of being drawn into great power conflicts  

- **Neutrality as a Strategy?**  
  - Dr. Pascal Lottaz's perspective: Is neutrality the best path for smaller nations?  
  - Can a country like Armenia realistically remain neutral, or is it inevitably forced to align with one side?  
  - Historical examples of successful neutral states—can Armenia follow a similar model?

## Key Questions Discussed  

### Shifting Global Power and Alliances  
- **China & Russia: A New Axis or Marriage of Convenience?**  
  - Has NATO’s post-Cold War expansion pushed Russia and China closer together?  
  - If the US had integrated Russia into Western institutions earlier, would today’s multipolarity look different?  
  - How solid is the China-Russia relationship, and could it evolve into its own geopolitical “pole”?  

- **The Rise of BRICS and the Future of Global Alliances**  
  - How does BRICS challenge Western financial dominance?  
  - Could BRICS replace the US-led global economic system?  
  - Turkey’s ambiguous position: Can a NATO member also join BRICS?  

- **The Future of NATO in a Multipolar World**  
  - As BRICS expands, can NATO maintain its role as a dominant military alliance?  
  - Could regional powers realign, shifting the global balance?  

### Small Countries in a Multipolar World  
- **Survival Strategies for Smaller Nations**  
  - How can small countries like Armenia avoid being caught between major geopolitical forces?  
  - Will they face increasing pressure to pick sides, and what would the new global divisions look like?  
  - Can true neutrality be an option, or is alignment inevitable?
