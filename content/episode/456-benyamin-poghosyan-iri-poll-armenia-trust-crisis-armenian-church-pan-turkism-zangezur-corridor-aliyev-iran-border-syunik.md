This Week in Review episode covers growing public disillusionment in Armenia, as new polling shows historic lows in trust toward political institutions while support for the Armenian Church and Armed Forces holds strong. We examine Pashinyan’s shifting rhetoric on the so-called “Zangezur Corridor,” his ongoing confrontation with the Church, and the geopolitical fallout from recent regional events—including the Iran-Israel conflict and the cooling of Russia-Azerbaijan ties. Dr. **Benyamin Poghosyan** joins to discuss whether Armenia is facing a crisis of legitimacy and a turning point in its strategic posture.

# Main Topics Addressed

- **Corridor Logic**  
  How Aliyev’s demands for a “Zangezur Corridor” persist, even as Pashinyan’s rhetoric shifts—from denial to adopting terms like “corridor” and even referencing “Turan.”

- **Crackdown Logic**  
  Pashinyan’s targeting of Church leaders and critics, including the potential nationalization of Samvel Karapetyan’s companies like ENA, under the pretext of anti-corruption.

- **IRI Poll Findings**  
  Widespread political disillusionment:  
  - 61% trust no political leader  
  - Pashinyan drops to 13%, Kocharyan up to 4%  
  - The Armenian Church and Armed Forces emerge as most trusted institutions

- **Russia-Azerbaijan Relations**  
  Following the ethnic cleansing of Artsakh, Russia loses leverage in the region; Aliyev pivots westward.

- **Armenia’s Mixed Messaging**  
  Pashinyan affirms Armenia is not leaving the EAEU while integrating EU/US standards. Trade drops 45%—linked to Ukraine war and reliance on Russia.

- **Georgia’s Balancing Act**  
  Western pressure on Tbilisi over municipal elections contrasts with Georgia’s relatively stable ties with Russia.

- **Implications of the Iran–Israel 12-Day War**  
  Armenia’s vulnerability if Iran destabilizes: refugee risk in Syunik, trade disruption, emboldened Azerbaijan.

# Key Questions Discussed

- What is Pashinyan really negotiating behind closed doors with Aliyev?  
- Has the Iranian “red line” against the corridor weakened after recent regional shifts?  
- Are crackdowns aimed at silencing dissent ahead of 2026, or about consolidating wealth and power?  
- Why do younger Armenians support the Church despite official hostility?  
- With 61% of the public distrusting all politicians, what kind of political change is possible?  
- Has Aliyev truly abandoned Russia, and is Armenia telling the truth about its Eurasian vs. European alignment?

# Thoughts from the Participants
