# Summary
We spoke with MP Arthur Khachatryan about three fronts shaping Armenia’s near term, Euronest politics and what EU rhetoric vs. executive policy means for Yerevan, Aliyev’s transit announcement and the TRIPP push, and a deepening domestic clampdown that now targets the Armenian Church and elected local officials. We also covered the Gyumri mayor’s detention and new “Article 422” speech charges, how these moves feed into the 2026 elections, and why real de-blocking requires practical, two-way access rather than headlines.

# Main Topics Addressed
- Euronest session in Yerevan, EU politics vs. practice
- Aliyev’s “transit” move, TRIPP, and real de-blocking tests
- Crackdown on the Armenian Church and use of a defrocked priest
- Gyumri mayor’s arrest, Article 422, and due process concerns
- 2026 elections landscape, opposition strategies, and civic mood

# Key Questions Discussed
- What did Armenia gain from hosting Euronest, and what did EU legislators signal versus EU executives?
- Does Aliyev’s announcement change border reality for Armenian goods and travelers, or is it a one-off?
- What would genuine de-blocking look like for rail and road, including Ijevan–Ghazakh and Sadarak–Yeraskh gaps?
- Who benefits from a weakened Armenian Church, and how far can state interference go under the Constitution?
- How do the Gyumri detentions and Article 422 affect local governance and national quorum math ahead of 2026?
- Can opposition parties and emerging movements translate discontent into a coherent 2026 strategy?

# Thoughts from the Participants
- **Hovik:** Armenia has become a surveillance state. The scope needed to film and hold kompromat suggests far greater capacity than is publicly acknowledged, which clashes with EU praise.
- **Arthur Khachatryan:** Pashinyan’s budget address reframed the army from "combat-ready" to “defense-capable,” which signals externally imposed limits and invites new demands. It is a troubling shift for deterrence and doctrine, and indicates capitulation.
