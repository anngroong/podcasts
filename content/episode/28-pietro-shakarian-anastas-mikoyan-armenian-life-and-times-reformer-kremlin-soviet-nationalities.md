Born in 1895 in Sanahin, Armenia, Anastas Mikoyan rose to become the most influential Soviet statesman of Armenian origin. A political survivor, he navigated the power struggles of every Soviet regime from Lenin to Brezhnev, at one point becoming Khrushchev’s right-hand man and the second most powerful figure in the USSR. His legacy remains controversial and complex.  
Today on **Groong**, we take a closer look at this extraordinary and enigmatic figure.

Joining us is **Pietro Shakarian**, a historian and PhD candidate in Russian history at **The Ohio State University**. His dissertation examines Mikoyan’s role in Khrushchev-era reforms, particularly de-Stalinization and Soviet nationality policy. Pietro’s work on Russia, Armenia, and the post-Soviet world has been featured in *The Nation*, the *Cleveland Plain Dealer*, the Russian International Affairs Council, *Russia Direct*, and *Hetq*. He has also collaborated with the **Gomidas Institute** in London on republishing 19th-century accounts of the Russian Caucasus and Armenia.
