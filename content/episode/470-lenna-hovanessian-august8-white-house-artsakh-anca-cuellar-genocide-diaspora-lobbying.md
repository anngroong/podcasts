In this Conversations on Groong episode, we speak with Lenna Hovanessian, board member of the ANC-Western Region, about the aftermath of the August 8 White House meeting between Pashinyan, Aliyev, and Trump. We discuss the omissions in the agreements, including the rights of Artsakh Armenians, the release of hostages, and protection of cultural heritage. The conversation also covers the Section 907 waiver, dissolution of the OSCE Minsk Group, strained diaspora–Armenia relations, Pashinyan’s stance on Genocide recognition, Azerbaijan’s lobbying efforts, and the Cuellar bribery case, where ANCA has asked that Armenian Americans be designated as victims.
