## **Summary**
In this Conversations on Groong episode, we speak with longtime antiwar author and radio host Scott Horton, whose latest book Provoked: How Washington Started the New Cold War with Russia and the Catastrophe in Ukraine lays out how decades of U.S. provocations — from NATO expansion to proxy wars and pipeline politics — set the stage for the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. We also discuss the silencing of dissent in American media, the disappearance of the antiwar left, and how Armenia fits into the evolving chessboard of U.S. foreign policy.

## **Main Topics Addressed**
- How the U.S. provoked Russia into war with Ukraine  
- The role of NATO expansion and Western interference in post-Soviet states  
- Maidan, Minsk, and the road to war  
- The silencing of antiwar voices in American media and politics  
- Armenia’s precarious role in post-Soviet pipeline geopolitics  
- Media narratives and the suppression of dissenting views  
- Washington’s bipartisan war consensus and the think tank ecosystem  
- Trump’s stance on Russia, NATO, and the war  
- How war with Russia risks global catastrophe  

## **Key Questions Discussed**
- What are the main provocations by the U.S. that led to the Ukraine war, according to Scott Horton?  
- Why does the author argue that the war could have been avoided?  
- How have media and think tanks shaped public understanding of the war?  
- What happened to the antiwar movement in the U.S. since the early 2000s?  
- Why did Minsk II fail, and what role did the West play in that failure?  
- How do oil and gas pipeline politics intersect with U.S. policy in the Caucasus, especially for Armenia?  
- What are the broader dangers of continuing to escalate this war?
