# Summary
Bedros Afeyan speaks with photographer and photojournalist Erhan Arik about the personal shock that drove him to make **Horovel**, his long-term work with elderly Armenians in Armenia whose families came from historic Armenian regions, and the ethical choices involved in witnessing, listening, and photographing. They then discuss the return journey that became **Ojakh** with Diana Mkrtchyan, how authorship changes when the camera and narrative belong to someone else, and what it means to become a character in another person’s film. The conversation broadens to **Gayan**, Erhan’s Middle East work across several countries, and how Armenian identity, memory, and community adapt across different political and social contexts. They close with Erhan’s current documentary project **Our Seeds (Tohum)**, using the story of an ancient wheat seed tradition as a metaphor for inheritance, rupture, and continuity.

## Main Topics Addressed
- Erhan’s personal entry point into Armenian absence and presence, and why a single “hearth” image became a moral trigger.
- **Horovel** as a cross-border memory project, and the practical constraints of border zones and trust-building.
- The ethics of photojournalism: when the camera helps, when it harms, and how “distance” protects the subject’s story.
- A pivotal encounter with Dikranouhi Asadourian, and what consent and agency look like in practice.
- Returning years later and re-encountering people as time changes memory, expectations, and responsibility.
- **Ojakh** as a second trip with a different author, and how Erhan’s role shifts when the film is Diana Mkrtchyan’s.
- **Gayan** as a wider regional lens, and what remains common across Armenian communities in different countries.
- **Our Seeds (Tohum)** and “seed” as a non-ideological metaphor for continuity across generations.

## Key Questions Discussed
1. What personal rupture begins a serious body of work, and why does it create an obligation to act?
2. What does “Horovel” mean in context, and what does that reveal about cultural loss and distortion?
3. How do you enter a community ethically when your presence can trigger pain, anger, or distrust?
4. Where is the line between witnessing and taking, and how does a photographer avoid becoming the story?
5. What changes when you return years later, and how does time reshape both the subject and the documentarian?
6. What changes when someone else holds authorship, and you move from observer to character?
7. What is shared across Armenian communities in Armenia and the Middle East, and what is shaped by local politics?
8. Why frame a regional project around “Gayan” as a gathering and searching point after catastrophe?
9. What can a “seed” story express about inheritance and survival that memory projects cannot say directly?
