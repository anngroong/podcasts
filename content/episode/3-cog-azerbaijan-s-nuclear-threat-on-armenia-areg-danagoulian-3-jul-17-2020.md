## The Threat on the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant

In this segment **Asbed Kotchikian** discusses a wide variety of aspects of the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP) at Metsamor with **Areg Danagulian**. The ANPP’s significance to Armenia’s economy, energy security, and independence cannot be overstated. The power plant was shut down in 1989 following the devastating earthquake in Spitak, and when it was brought back online in 1995 after being shut down since 1989 it served as a lifeline and helped fuel Armenia’s economic growth for the next two decades.
