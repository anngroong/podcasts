# Summary
Five years after the 44-Day War, we take stock of what changed and what did not. Arthur Martirosyan reviews lessons Armenia still has not learned, then looks at the __Ukraine war__’s likely path and the risks of an __Iran-Israel escalation__ for Armenia. We discuss key claims from __Serge Sargsyan__’s long interview on the Imnemnimi Podcast and __Robert Kocharyan__’s  interviewon Channel 5, including alleged missed ceasefire windows, and we cover __Narek Karapetyan’s appearance on Tucker Carlson__ about church persecution and Armenia’s drift toward rule by law.
