# **Summary**
We spoke with Dr. Sergei Melkonian about the shifting fronts in the Ukraine war, Russia’s winter strategy, and how these dynamics tie into Trump’s post-Alaska summit ceasefire diplomacy. We also discussed the rising risk of an Iran–Israel war, Iran’s view of the TRIPP (Trump Route) corridor in Armenia, and the strategic opening the U.S. is making in Central Asia with the C5+1 summit. Finally, we reviewed the Vagharshapat municipal election, reports of administrative resource abuse, the role of state-affiliated NGOs, and what this vote may or may not signal for Armenia’s 2026 parliamentary elections.

# **Thoughts from the Participants**

- **Sergei Melkonian:** Armenia must keep the POW issue and the destruction of Armenian heritage in Artsakh in constant focus, regardless of the government’s avoidance of the topic.  
- **Hovik Manucharyan:** Media repression is intensifying, from arrests of journalists to harassment of outlets. International journalists should cover these developments.
