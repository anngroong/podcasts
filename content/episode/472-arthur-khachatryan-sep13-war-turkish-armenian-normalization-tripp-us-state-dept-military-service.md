This Week in Review, we’re joined by Arthur Khachatryan to discuss key events shaping Armenia’s security and politics.  

# Main Topics Addressed  
- The third anniversary of the September 13, 2022 war and its ongoing consequences.
- Turkish envoy Serdar Kiliç’s visit to Armenia and “expediting” normalization projects.
- U.S. State Department’s $145M announcement for the TRIPP (Trump Route / Zangezur Corridor).
- Draft bill to shorten mandatory military service and Pashinyan’s decision to cut defense spending.
- Broader government underperformance in project implementation.
- Armenia’s army and police size in 2025.

# Key Questions Discussed  
- What lessons remain from the September 13 war, and why is it downplayed by the government?
- What is the real purpose behind Serdar Kiliç’s “expediting” language—progress or propaganda?
- What details of the TRIPP are being withheld from the Armenian public, and why?
- Can Armenia afford reduced military service and a shrinking defense budget when all its neighbors are rearming?
- Why are so many government projects underperforming, and where is the accountability?
