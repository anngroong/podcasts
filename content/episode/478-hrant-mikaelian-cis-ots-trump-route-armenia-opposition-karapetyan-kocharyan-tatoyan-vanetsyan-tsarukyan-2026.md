# Summary
This episode covers Armenia’s growing geopolitical balancing act as regional and domestic politics intensify ahead of the 2026 elections. Hrant Mikaelian joins to analyze Pashinyan’s “Trump Route” pitch at the CIS summit, Aliyev’s renewed push for the Zangezur Corridor, and Russia’s diplomatic recalibration after the AZAL crash. The discussion then turns to Armenia’s changing political landscape, including Samvel Karapetyan’s *In Our Way* movement, Arman Tatoyan’s *Wings of Unity*, and Robert Kocharyan’s proposal for a more sovereign, multi-route strategy to connect Armenia with its neighbors.

# Main Topics Addressed
- **CIS Summit in Dushanbe** – Pashinyan’s pitch of the “Trump Route” (TRIPP) and its reception among CIS leaders.  
- **Putin–Aliyev Meeting** – Russia’s renewed apology over the AZAL crash and a cautious thaw in relations.  
- **OTS Summit in Gabbala** – Aliyev’s aggressive promotion of the “Zangezur Corridor” within the Pan-Turkic framework.  
- **Armenia’s Domestic Politics** –  
  - Samvel Karapetyan’s *In Our Way* movement and Daron Acemoglu’s appearance at its rally.  
  - The entry of Arman Tatoyan’s *Wings of Unity* initiative.  
  - Robert Kocharyan’s press conference outlining an alternative to the TRIPP corridor and major economic projects.

---

# Thoughts from the Participants
- **Hovik:** A satirical “rant” comparing the short TRIPP (42 km) to the longer Yeraskh–Julfa line (120 km), highlighting Armenia’s need for sovereignty and reciprocity in any transport project.  
- **Hrant:** Warned that Turkey and Azerbaijan may later push the U.S. out of the TRIPP framework and urged Washington to understand the deeper regional interests at play.
