# Summary
We spoke with Ambassador Dziunik Aghajanian about three linked fronts that shape Armenia’s risk picture today: the Ukraine war and a possible Trump–Putin meeting in Budapest, the Gaza ceasefire push and the roles of Qatar and Turkey, and widening political prosecutions in Armenia, including arrests of senior clergy and opposition figures. We also looked at the risk of strikes on Iran, why nearby corridors matter for Tehran’s calculus, and how these external pressures feed back into Armenia’s domestic scene. The conversation focused on the week ending October 19, 2025.

# Main Topics Addressed
- Ukraine war inflection points and outcomes
- Budapest meeting optics and Orban’s role
- Gaza ceasefire mechanics and mediators
- Risks and triggers for strikes on Iran
- Corridors and Iran’s view of Armenia
- Arrests of clergy and opposition in Armenia

# Key Questions Discussed
- What would Washington consider success in Ukraine, and how would that shape Russia’s posture in the South Caucasus?
- If Trump and Putin meet in Budapest, what signals should Armenia watch for before and after the meeting?
- Is the Gaza ceasefire a pause or a bridge to a broader deal, and how central are Qatar and Turkey in that process?
- How real is near-term escalation against Iran, and what indicators would precede it?
- What goals drive the arrests of clergy, lawyers, and mayors in Armenia, and what does this say about rule of law?

# Thoughts from the Participants

- **Dziunik:** Sharm el-Sheikh was optics, not substance. The core struggle is over Armenian identity, not a narrow Armenia–Azerbaijan frame.
- **Hovik:** The Armenian Church is integral to identity, and attempts to reshape it will not succeed.
