In this episode of Groong Week in Review, we speak with Arthur Khachatryan of the ARF about Armenia’s shifting political landscape. We reflect on Republic Day and the legacy of the First Armenian Republic, explore Armenia’s contradictory stance on EU membership amid Russian pressure, and examine Pashinyan’s push to amend the constitution to satisfy Azerbaijani demands. The conversation also covers rising opposition calls for either elections or impeachment, the growing threat of Azerbaijani aggression along Armenia’s borders, recent corruption scandals, and the implications of Armenia hosting the 2026 EPC Summit during an election year.

### Main Topics Addressed

- Can constitutional changes be used to bypass internal resistance to the peace deal?  
- Are elections or impeachment more realistic paths for regime change?  
- How does the ARF view participation in 2026, and will it remain in the Hayastan alliance?
