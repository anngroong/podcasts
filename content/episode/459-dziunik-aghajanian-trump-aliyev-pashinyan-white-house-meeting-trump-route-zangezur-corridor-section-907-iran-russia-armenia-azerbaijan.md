# **Summary**  
This Week in Review examines the August 8, 2025 White House meeting between Donald Trump, Nikol Pashinyan, and Ilham Aliyev. Ambassador Dziunik Aghajanian joins to discuss the geopolitical fallout from the initialed but yet-unsigned “peace agreement,” the 99-year Trump Corridor lease through Armenia, and the scrapping of Section 907. The conversation covers the agreement’s omissions, Iran’s mixed but wary reaction, Russia’s cautious stance, and the broader strategic implications for Armenia’s sovereignty and security.

## **Thoughts from the Participants**  
- **Hovik**: Imagine if the Armenian Apostolic Church were the Vatinan, where would the global outrage be if the Vatican were targeted the way the Armenian Church is being targeted?
- **Dziunik**: The Karabakh movement was rooted in self-determination and self-defense after pogroms in Azerbaijan, fully legal under Soviet law.
