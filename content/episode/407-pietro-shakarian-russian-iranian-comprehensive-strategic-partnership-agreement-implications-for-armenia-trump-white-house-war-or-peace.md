In this Conversations on Groong episode, we discuss the recently signed Russian-Iranian Comprehensive Strategic Partnership treaty with historian Dr. Pietro Shakarian. The treaty, signed in January 2025, is a significant development in Eurasian geopolitics, encompassing military, economic, and cultural cooperation. We explore its implications for Armenia, the South Caucasus, and the broader region, as well as its intersection with global power dynamics involving the United States, Europe, and Israel.

### Topics Covered

- Russian-Iranian Comprehensive Strategic Partnership treaty
- Implications of the treaty for Armenia and the South Caucasus
- Eurasian geopolitics and the significance of Articles 12 and 13 of the treaty
- Azerbaijanâ€™s strategic importance and its relationships with Turkey, Israel, and the West
- The role of the International North-South Trade Corridor (INSTC) and regional infrastructure
- The geopolitical implications of U.S., Russian, and Iranian interactions

### Key Questions Discussed

- Why was the Russian-Iranian Comprehensive Strategic Partnership treaty needed, and what are its historical underpinnings?
- What differentiates the treaty from a formal military alliance?
- How does the treatyâ€™s Article 12 define regional peace and security, particularly for the Caspian, Central Asia, Transcaucasia, and the Middle East?
- How might this treaty influence the geopolitical orientations of Armenia and Azerbaijan?
- What is the strategic significance of the International North-South Trade Corridor, particularly in relation to the Rasht-Astara railway?
