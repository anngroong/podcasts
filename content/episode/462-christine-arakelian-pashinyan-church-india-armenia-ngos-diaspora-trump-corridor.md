In this episode, Christine Arakelian joins us for a deep dive into Armenia’s political crossroads. We discuss Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s confrontation with the Armenian Apostolic Church, the arrests of clergy and business leaders, and the chilling effect on society. We explore India-Armenia relations and why opportunities with New Delhi remain untapped, the heavy influence of Western-funded NGOs and the role of new groups like *Save Armenia: A Judeo-Christian Alliance*, as well as the government’s growing estrangement from the Armenian diaspora. Finally, we place these developments in the context of U.S. politics, Trump’s foreign policy, and the strategic game around the Trump Corridor.
