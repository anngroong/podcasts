In this Conversations on Groong episode, we speak with Levon Zourabian, Vice President of the Armenian National Congress (ANC), about the rising political temperature in Armenia ahead of the 2026 parliamentary elections. We explore the fragile geopolitical environment surrounding Armenia—from renewed US-Iran negotiations and the expansion of the Abraham Accords to Russia’s shifting posture in Ukraine and the South Caucasus. Zourabian also weighs in on the Armenia-Azerbaijan talks, Lavrov’s visit to Yerevan, and whether a new political coalition can challenge Nikol Pashinyan’s hold on power.
