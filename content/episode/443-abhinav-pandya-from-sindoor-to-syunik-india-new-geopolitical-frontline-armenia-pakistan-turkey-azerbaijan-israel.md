In this episode of Conversations on Groong, we speak with Abhinav Pandya about the emerging Turkey–Pakistan–Azerbaijan axis and its implications for India’s security and regional posture. We explore the symbolism behind the opening of an empty airport in Berdzor (Lachin), the broader strategic coordination among these three nations, and how India responded with Operation Sindoor following a major terror attack in Pahalgam. The conversation also looks at Armenia’s growing role as a strategic partner for India, the complexities of managing ties with Iran, and the challenges facing multilateral projects like IMEC. Pandya outlines the ideological and hybrid threats India faces and what it must do to stay ahead in a shifting geopolitical landscape.
