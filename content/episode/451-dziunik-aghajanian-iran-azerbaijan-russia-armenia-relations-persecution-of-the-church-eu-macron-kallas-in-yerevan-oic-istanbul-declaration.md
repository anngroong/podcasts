## üéôÔ∏è Summary  

In this Week in Review, former ambassador Dziunik Aghajanian joins the show to unpack a week of escalating tensions across Armenia‚Äôs borders and within. The discussion covers the aftermath of Israel‚Äôs war on Iran, claims that Azerbaijan facilitated Israeli strikes, and a sudden fallout between Baku and Moscow after raids and retaliatory actions. Domestically, the Pashinyan government‚Äôs crackdown on the Armenian Church deepens, even as Emmanuel Macron offers public support. The episode also examines Kaja Kallas' visit to Armenia and new EU-Armenia defense consultations, as well as Iran‚Äôs support for the OIC‚Äôs pro-Azerbaijani Istanbul Declaration.

## üß≠ Main Topics Addressed
- Israel‚Äôs war on Iran and its aftermath
- Iran-Azerbaijan tensions over use of airspace by Israeli drones
- Russia-Azerbaijan fallout after police raids and media suppression
- Frictions in Russian-Armenian trade and the EAEU
- The Armenian government‚Äôs deepening crackdown on the Church
- Macron‚Äôs endorsement of Pashinyan amid political unrest
- EU-Armenia defense talks following Kaja Kallas‚Äô visit
- Iran‚Äôs support for the OIC‚Äôs Istanbul Declaration

## ‚ùì Key Questions Discussed
- What does Iran‚Äôs response to Israeli attacks reveal about its red lines?
- Is Azerbaijan‚Äôs collaboration with Israeli operations sustainable?
- Are Russia and Azerbaijan undergoing a real rupture or just a public spat?
- Is Armenia risking its economic position by distancing from Russia?
- What does the government‚Äôs crackdown on the Church mean for Armenia‚Äôs democracy?
- How should we interpret Macron‚Äôs endorsement of Pashinyan during this crisis?
- What real security value does the EU offer Armenia?
- Why did Iran back a strongly pro-Azerbaijani declaration at the OIC?

## üí¨ Thoughts from the Participants
- **Dziunik:** The government‚Äôs actions against Holy Etchmiadzin are an attack on Armenian identity. Many are grieving, but also beginning to resist.
- **Hovik:** New MPG poll shows nearly 80% disapprove of the crackdown on the Church. This has hurt Pashinyan‚Äôs standing and may spark broader political pushback.
