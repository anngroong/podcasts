# Summary
__Armen Ashotyan__, vice president of the Republican Party of Armenia, explains the opposition’s plan for a no-confidence path against Pashinyan, how impeachment procedure pairs with street mobilization, and why opposition unity matters ahead of 2026. We also unpack TRIPP, the announced U.S. funding, and the gap between “up to 99 years” language heard in Washington and what appears in the MoUs published by Yerevan. Ashotyan rejects the “Pashinyan or war” binary and says real peace requires security first.

# Main Topics Addressed
- Why Pativ Unem issued a statement to initiate a no-confidence process, and how hearings could involve non-parliamentary actors.  
- Impeachment math, the 36-signature and 54-vote thresholds, and why public action must complement procedure.  
- TRIPP: U.S. funding announcements, “up to 99 years” remarks in Washington, and what is, and is not, in the published MoUs.  
- Opposition unity: differences with Hayastan, the role of Samvel Karapetyan’s “Mer Dzevov,” and priorities for coordination.  
- Responding to “Pashinyan or war,” readiness under repression, and turning public sentiment into public action.

# Key Questions Discussed
- What does the no-confidence statement aim to achieve, and how do hearings broaden participation beyond parliament?  
- Given 32 opposition MPs vs the 36-signature threshold, what is the realistic path to place the motion on the agenda and reach 54 votes?  
- What are the real commitments behind TRIPP if the MoUs omit “lease” and “99 years,” yet officials cite large funding and long duration?  
- Are the differences between Pativ Unem and Hayastan tactical or deeper, and how can the opposition present a united front?  
- If removing Pashinyan risks Azeri pressure, how does the opposition think about deterrence, security, and avoiding war while changing course?
