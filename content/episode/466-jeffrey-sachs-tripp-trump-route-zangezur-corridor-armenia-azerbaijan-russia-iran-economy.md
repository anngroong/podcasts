In this episode of *Conversations on Groong*, renowned economist Jeffrey Sachs joins to discuss the U.S.-brokered “TRIPP” (Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity), also known as the Zangezur Corridor. The discussion covers the risks of foreign powers imposing corridors through Armenia, the muted response from Moscow, Tehran’s strong opposition, and what this means for regional security. Sachs stresses that Armenia should not look to distant powers like the United States for security or stability, but instead pursue prudent arrangements and economic cooperation with its immediate neighbors—Russia, Iran, Turkey, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. He also gives candid advice on Armenia’s economy, its dependence on Russia, and the long-term challenges of EU aspirations.
