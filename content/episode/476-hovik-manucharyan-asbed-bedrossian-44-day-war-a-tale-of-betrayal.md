# Summary:
We reflect on September 27 and the 44-Day War, tracing how Pashinyan’s 2018 rise set the stage for broken negotiations, secret leader-to-leader contacts, poor defense choices, and a propaganda-laden war that the Armenian government failed to mobilize for. We revisit ceasefire rejections, Russia’s stand-off posture, and the postwar slide into demilitarization, border retreats, and historical revisionism. We close on accountability, the need for a real war commission, and the right of Artsakh’s people to return.

# Main Topics Addressed
- Pashinyan’s rise and Western backing  
- Breakdown of talks and secret meetings  
- Failures and propaganda during the war  
- Aftermath, revisionism, and political responsibility  

# Key Questions Discussed
- Why did Serzh Sargsyan resign rather than confront the 2018 movement?  
- Did Pashinyan stall or reset Minsk-Group talks and pursue backchannels with Aliyev?  
- How did defense procurement shifts and army restructuring weaken readiness?  
- Why was the state not fully mobilized, and why were ceasefires rejected?  
- What explains Russia’s limited role and the peacekeeper calculus?  
- Can there be dignified peace amid ethnic cleansing, demilitarization, and “memory-holing”?  
- What should a genuine, independent war inquiry examine first?

# Thoughts from the Participants
- **On responsibility:** A defeated, capitulating leader cannot negotiate on behalf of the nation.  
- **On peace:** Undignified peace invites future conflict, not stability.  
- **On Artsakh:** Seeking return and justice for Artsakh is a right, not “revanchism.”
