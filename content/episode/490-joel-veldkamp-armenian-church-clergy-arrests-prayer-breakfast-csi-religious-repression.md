## **Summary**

This episode of *Conversations on Groong* examines Armenia’s national “prayer breakfast” and the deepening repression against the Armenian Apostolic Church. Our guest, Joel Veldkamp of Christian Solidarity International (CSI), discusses his recent visit to Armenia, the arrests of clergy, the targeting of Church leadership, and the near-total silence from Western governments and many Christian groups. We explore why CSI is sounding the alarm, what is happening behind the government’s PR messaging, and what these developments mean for Armenia’s identity and future.
