# Summary
This week’s Week in Review with Hrant Mikaelian covers mounting tensions over Iran’s nuclear program and the risk of renewed war, Russia’s muted stance on the TRIPP corridor despite U.S. and Turkish advances, fresh data from the MPG poll on Armenia’s politics and society, and the state of Armenia’s economy at mid-2025, with particular focus on re-exports, debt, and government underperformance.

# Main Topics Addressed
- **War in Iran**: The E3 snapback sanctions, Iran’s possible NPT withdrawal, and risks of a U.S.-Israeli escalation.  
- **TRIPP Corridor**: U.S. and Israeli leverage, Paul Goble’s views, Russia’s puzzling response, Iran’s split stance.  
- **MPG Poll Findings**:  
  - Attitudes toward the Aug 8 White House TRIPP agreement.  
  - Views on opening a road through Syunik.  
  - Whether Washington agreements will bring peace.  
  - Constitutional change as a precondition from Azerbaijan.  
  - Political prisoners, including Samvel Karapetyan and Bagrat Srbazan.  
  - Party standings if elections were held today.  
- **Armenian Economy H1/2025**: Decline in re-exports, slowdown in industry, underperformance of key ministries, rising debt, and growth trends in construction and agriculture.  

# Key Questions Discussed
- Is the West pushing Iran into a corner, and could this lead to renewed war?  
- Could TRIPP serve as a launchpad for U.S. and Israeli operations against Iran?  
- Why is Russia muted while Paul Goble and U.S. analysts are exuberant?  
- What do the MPG poll results reveal about Armenian public opinion on TRIPP, peace prospects, constitutional change, and political prisoners?  
- Does Samvel Karapetyan’s rise in polling numbers suggest a viable opposition force in 2026?  
- How sustainable is Armenia’s economy given re-export decline, underperforming ministries, and rising debt?

# Armenian Economy H1/2025

The Luys Foundation released its [report](https://www.luys.am/img/artpic/small/272ea2668ff86421398504-2025-%D5%AB%D4%B2%D5%B5%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%BB%D5%A5%D5%AB1-%D5%AB%D5%B6%D5%AF%D5%AB%D5%BD%D5%A1%D5%B4%D5%B5%D5%A1%D5%AF%D5%AB%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%BF%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%B8%D5%B2%D5%A1%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%B6-2025.pdf) on the Armenian economy in the first half of 2025. As expected there is some slowdown which may have bottomed out in March or April and since then it has been rebounding. The slowdown is attributed to a 12.1% decrease in the industrial sector, which itself is being blamed on the very significant decrease in the re-export sector, which last year had reached (I think) the $12.4B mark, and as Russian deputy PM Alexei Overchuk has been citing, it’s barely over $6.1B in 2025.

Of significant concern is that many areas of the government’s programs have been underperforming, under-executing their planned projects in 2025.
* Ministry of High-Tech Industry, the underperformance of expenditures is 72.8%
    * This means that they’ve basically done 27% of their projects.
    * They have a mandate for developing the Armenian military-industrial complex
* Urban Development Committee - 58.7%
* Ministry of Environment - 34.3%
* Foreign Intelligence Service - 32.4%
* Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure - 22.8%
* Ministry of Economy - 22.3%
* Ministry of Higher Education and Science - 20.9%. 

We can see that a significant number of these areas haven’t even achieved half of what they were supposed to do. The Luys report highlights important programs:
* The “__Development Program for the Military-Industrial Complex__” implemented under the responsibility of the Ministry of High-Tech Industry which has been implemented only __4.7%__;
* Their “__Digital Transformation__" program is at __7.4%__;
* The Ministry of Economy’s "__Agricultural Modernization Program__" is at __12.6%__.

One odd aspect of this underperformance is that the government has not been spending at the level that it thought it would, so it has a lot of cash lying around, sitting in banks and earning some interest. So now all that money looks like an over-fulfillment of revenues in the state budget, or maybe a lower budget deficit. Exactly the opposite of what the government predicted would happen.

Despite all of these issues, the economy seems to be on the rebound. If we start including July numbers, we see that
* The industrial production slow down goes from 12.1 to 9.8%
* Electricity generation is up 2.1% (a good indicator of economic activity)
* Construction up 20%
* Services up 10.6%
* CPI has ticked up but still is a reasonable 3.2%, PPI is 2.5%
* Foreign trade is still down 41%: Exports down 48%, imports down 36%
