In this episode of Conversations on Groong, we speak with international human rights lawyer Robert Amsterdam about the arrest and pre-trial detention of Armenian businessman and Church benefactor Samvel Karapetyan. We explore how Armenia’s courts are being used in a campaign of lawfare targeting political opponents and the Armenian Apostolic Church, following growing tensions between Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s government and religious leaders. Amsterdam discusses the legal inconsistencies, the weaponization of pre-trial detention, and how these actions violate international norms. We also examine the broader consequences for Armenia’s legal system, religious freedom, and international reputation.
