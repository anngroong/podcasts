# Topics Covered

## Ukraine War Update

Ukraine’s battlefield situation continues to deteriorate, with reports of Ukrainian withdrawals from key positions amid shortages of weapons, manpower, and electricity. European leaders are increasingly divided on how to proceed, as French President Emmanuel Macron shifts toward dialogue with Moscow while blocking German efforts to seize Russian assets for Ukraine and lobbying to restore nuclear fuel cooperation with Russia.

Key developments discussed:

## Pashinyan vs. the Catholicos

### Etchmiadzin Under Siege

Following public denials of state involvement, events at Holy Etchmiadzin suggested coordinated pressure against the Armenian Apostolic Church. Ten renegade archbishops attempted to force the Catholicos’s resignation during evening worship, backed by security forces, while large crowds of supporters prevented their entry.

* Police and NSS escort details
  [https://www.azatutyun.am/a/33628203.html](https://www.azatutyun.am/a/33628203.html)

### The KGB “Leak”

A day later, civic.am published a purportedly declassified KGB document alleging that Archbishop Ezras, the Catholicos’s brother, collaborated with Soviet intelligence in 1986–1988. The document raised major authenticity concerns, including format irregularities, Armenian-language text, and lack of confirmation by the National Security Service.

### December 28

Media reports claim that Pashinyan plans to personally go to Etchmiadzin on December 28 to force the Catholicos’s removal, marking a potential escalation from indirect pressure to direct confrontation.

## Transport and Communications

### The “Peace Dividend”

The government promoted the arrival of Azerbaijani fuel to Armenia as the first bilateral commercial transaction in decades, framing it as an early peace dividend under the August 8 Washington framework. Critics questioned the political nature of the deal, Georgia’s one-time transit waiver, lack of formal relations with Azerbaijan, and whether the fuel actually reduces dependence on Russia.

* Dependence on Russian imports

### T(rump)RIPP vs. P(utin)RIPP

Russia reasserted its claim over transit routes under the November 10, 2020 statement, signaling readiness to participate in the TRIPP project based on rail concessions, border guard presence, and Armenia’s EAEU membership. Pashinyan rejected Russian involvement, insisting TRIPP is a bilateral Armenia–U.S. initiative.

# Key Questions Discussed

* Does Europe’s internal division over Ukraine signal a shift toward negotiations with Russia?
* Did public resistance at Etchmiadzin represent a rare defeat for Pashinyan?
* Is the campaign against the Church legal, political, or personal?
* What purpose did the KGB “leak” serve, regardless of authenticity?
* Is Azerbaijani fuel a genuine peace dividend or political theater?
* Can Armenia realistically balance U.S. and Russian interests in TRIPP?
