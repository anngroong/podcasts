# Summary
In this milestone 500th episode of *Groong Week in Review*, we assess how major external crises are shaping Armenia’s strategic environment in 2025, examine the stalled Armenia–Azerbaijan process, analyze Russia’s posture around TRIPP, and discuss the implications of a change in the U.S. ambassador. The episode concludes with an extended year-end review, where each participant evaluates their 2025 predictions from a year ago (in [Episode 403](https://podcasts.groong.org/403)), and presents high-, medium-, and low-probability forecasts for 2026.

# Year-End Review: 2025 Self-Assessments

**Asbed Bedrossian (3/3 correct).**  
Asbed predicted that the Ukraine war would slow without a decisive resolution, that Gaza would remain a humanitarian catastrophe amid global indifference, and that Armenia would avoid regime collapse while relying on Western loans and accumulating debt. By the end of 2025, all three assessments were borne out.

**Hovik Manucharyan (2/3 correct).**  
Hovik identified Iran as the main regional flashpoint and expected the Ukraine war to slow rather than end, both of which largely materialized. He also warned that Armenia faced no positive trajectory without regime change and that an Azerbaijani attack was a matter of timing, which did not occur in 2025.

**Benyamin Poghosyan (3/3 correct).**  
Benyamin framed Ukraine as the central global variable of 2025, predicted Iran would emerge as the main regional flashpoint, and argued that no genuine Armenia–Azerbaijan peace agreement would be reached. Developments during the year confirmed all three assessments.

# Outlook: 2026 Predictions

#### Benyamin Poghosyan
- **High probability:** Continued instability in the South Caucasus, with Azerbaijan preserving escalation leverage rather than finalizing peace.  
- **Medium probability:** A slowdown or freeze in the Ukraine war that allows Russia to redirect attention toward its southern flank, including the South Caucasus and Iran.  
- **Low probability:** A comprehensive and durable Armenia–Azerbaijan peace agreement in 2026.

#### Hovik Manucharyan
- **High probability:** Pashinyan remains in power after the 2026 parliamentary elections, including through falsified or heavily managed voting.  
- **Medium probability:** Ongoing political deterioration without decisive regime change.  
- **Low probability:** A clean, competitive election producing a legitimate transfer of power.

#### Asbed Bedrossian
- **High probability:** A renewed phase of the Israel–Iran war, with Iran sustaining damage but surviving, and Armenia facing pressure to avoid being used against Iran through projects such as TRIPP.  
- **Medium probability:** Armenia formally exits the CSTO, replaces Russian energy with Azerbaijani supplies, and issues notice for Russia to vacate the 102nd base, triggering severe regional consequences.  
- **Low probability:** Pashinyan loses the June 2026 parliamentary elections, as most strategic concessions are already being achieved without open war.
