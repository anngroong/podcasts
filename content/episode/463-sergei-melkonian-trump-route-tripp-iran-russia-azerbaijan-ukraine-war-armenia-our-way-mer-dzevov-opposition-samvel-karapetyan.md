# Summary  
This Week in Review covers the Trump-Putin Alaska summit, the rebranded Trump Route (TRIPP) through Syunik, shifting Russian-Azerbaijani relations, Moscow’s recalibration with Iran after the U.S.-Israeli war, and the emergence of a new Armenian opposition movement called Our Way. __Dr. Sergei Melkonian__ analyzes the stakes for Armenia, Iran, Russia, and Azerbaijan, plus domestic political shifts in Yerevan.

# Main Topics Addressed  
- Trump-Putin Alaska summit and implications for Ukraine and Europe  
- Trump Corridor politics: Armenia, Iran, Russia, and the TRIPP project  
- Russian-Azerbaijani tensions over SOCAR strikes and regional power shifts  
- Russian-Iranian relations after the 12-day U.S.-Israeli war on Iran  
- Armenia’s emerging opposition movement Our Way led by Samvel Karapetyan  

# Key Questions Discussed  
- What was achieved at the Alaska summit, and is a negotiated end to the Ukraine war possible?  
- Were Iran and Russia caught off guard by the Washington accords on the Trump Route?  
- Who speaks for Iran when we interpret its divided responses?  
- What are Russia’s interests and red lines in the corridor issue, and does the Trump Route clash with Point 9 of the 2020 ceasefire?  
- Why are Russian-Azerbaijani relations deteriorating, and is TRIPP a cause or a symptom?  
- How is Russia reshaping its diplomacy with Iran after the war?  
- Does the emergence of Our Way mark a real reshaping of Armenia’s political landscape?

# Thoughts from the Participants  
- **Sergei Melkonian**: Azerbaijan is not interested in peace while the Western Azerbaijan agenda, prisoners, and the ethnic cleansing of Artsakh remain unaddressed.  
- **Hovik Manucharyan**: Constitutional preconditions placed on Armenia make a real peace deal unattainable.
