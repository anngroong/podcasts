In this episode, Hovik and Asbed discuss the quiet but consequential meeting between Nikol Pashinyan and Ilham Aliyev in Abu Dhabi, and the parallel crackdown unfolding in Armenia against opposition figures, church leaders, and academics. With no official deal signed, the conversation focuses on the deeper implications of "outsourcing" corridor control and the broader geopolitical realignments under way.
