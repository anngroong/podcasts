# Diana Mkrtchyan – *Ojakh: On the Other Side of Silence*  

![Ojakh: On the Other Side of Silence](/img/episode/499/Ojakh-movie-info.webp "Ojakh: On the Other Side of Silence")


# Episode Summary
In this episode, guest host Bedros Afeyan speaks with documentary filmmaker Diana Mkrtchyan about her feature documentary *Ojakh: On the Other Side of Silence*. The conversation traces the film’s nine-year development, its origins in Turkish photographer Erhan Arik’s *Horovel* project, and the urgent effort to document the last living Armenian Genocide survivors in border villages. The discussion also addresses artistic responsibility, dignity in testimony, cultural memory, censorship, and the continuity between Genocide-era trauma and the recent destruction of Artsakh.

# Key Exchanges Between Bedros Afeyan and Diana Mkrtchyan

- **Urgency versus production timelines**
  Mkrtchyan explains why *Ojakh* could not follow standard European documentary schedules, as many of the survivors were near the end of their lives. Delay meant permanent loss of testimony.

- **Dignity over victimhood**
  Both stress that the film avoids sentimental framing. Survivors are presented as composed witnesses, not objects of pity.

- **The role of a Turkish photographer**
  Erhan Arik’s presence undermines denial through human encounter rather than argument.

- **State silence versus living memory**
  Despite minimal institutional support, audiences traveled from border regions to see the film.

- **From 1915 to Artsakh**
  The discussion draws a direct line between Genocide testimonies and Mkrtchyan’s documentation of Artsakh.
