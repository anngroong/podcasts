In this episode of Conversations on Groong, we speak with Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, to analyze the geopolitical fallout from Israel’s surprise military campaign against Iran, known as Operation Rising Lion. We explore how the attacks may sabotage U.S.-Iran nuclear negotiations, shift Russia’s strategic calculus, and destabilize the South Caucasus—particularly Armenia’s Syunik province. We also examine the implications for Russia-Iran relations, the Zangezur corridor, and Azerbaijan’s military posture. Finally, we discuss Ukraine’s Operation Spiderweb, recent Russian rhetoric labeling Ukraine a terrorist state, and whether Moscow is preparing to escalate its war effort.

## Main Topics Addressed

- Israel’s Operation Rising Lion and its strategic goals  
- U.S.-Iran nuclear talks derailed by the strikes  
- Russia-Iran strategic partnership under pressure  
- Armenia’s vulnerability amid shifting regional dynamics  
- Ukraine’s Operation Spiderweb and Russia’s possible escalation  

## Key Questions Discussed

- How does Moscow view Israel’s attacks on Iran, and what is Russia’s strategic stake?  
- Was Israel’s goal truly to neutralize Iran’s nuclear program, or is regime change in play?  
- What does the derailment of nuclear negotiations signal about U.S. intentions?  
- Is Russia’s partnership with Iran strong enough to deter further aggression?  
- Could Armenia lose its southern province if Iran is weakened?  
- What are Russia’s real interests in the Zangezur Corridor?  
- Has Ukraine’s deep-strike campaign shifted Russia’s rules of engagement?  
- Will the “Special Military Operation” become a declared counter-terror operation?
