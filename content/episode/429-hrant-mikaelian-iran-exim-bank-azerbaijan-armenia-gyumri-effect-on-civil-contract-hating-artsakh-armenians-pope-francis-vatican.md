## **Main Topics Addressed**

- **US-Iran Talks & Israeli Threats:**  
  Israel is considering limited strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, even as the U.S. and Iran resume nuclear negotiations in Rome. Russia has emerged as a potential mediator, raising questions about its growing role in regional diplomacy.

- **Trump Administration Support for Azerbaijan:**  
  The U.S. Export-Import Bank approved a $339M loan to Azerbaijan’s Silk Way Airlines, despite its ties to arms transport and the Aliyev regime—igniting backlash over the contradiction with U.S. human rights commitments.

- **Iran-Azerbaijan Relations & Corridor Demands:**  
  Iran’s President Pezeshkian will visit Baku for high-level talks, with connectivity through Nakhichevan on the agenda. Azerbaijan continues to pressure Armenia for unrestricted extraterritorial access, despite already having controlled routes via Iran.

- **Vatican Controversy & Global Anti-Armenian Propaganda:**  
  In the final weeks of Pope Francis’s life, the Vatican hosted a conference backed by Azerbaijan that promoted revisionist narratives erasing Armenian Christian history. Days later, Azerbaijan staged a similar exhibit in Warsaw, furthering its global disinformation campaign.

- **Local Elections in Gyumri and Parakar:**  
  Armenia’s ruling Civil Contract party lost ground in both cities, with opposition candidates taking mayoral control. The results are seen as a rebuke of the government ahead of possible constitutional and EU-related referenda.

- **Government-Fueled Hate Against Artsakh Refugees:**  
  Top Armenian officials made inflammatory statements blaming Artsakh refugees for their own displacement. Civil society and media linked to the ruling party amplified the rhetoric, while the state cuts support programs—fueling accusations of a deliberate campaign of hostility.

## **Key Questions Discussed**

- What impact would an Israeli strike on Iran have on the progress of U.S.-Iran negotiations?  
- Can Russia’s mediation boost its influence in the South Caucasus, and at what cost to Armenia?  
- How did Vatican institutions become platforms for Azerbaijani historical revisionism?  
- Why is the U.S. financing Azerbaijan’s state-linked airline despite its role in arms trafficking?  
- Do recent local election outcomes signal a broader collapse of support for Civil Contract?  
- What is the Armenian government trying to achieve by inciting hatred against Artsakh refugees?
