## üéôÔ∏è Summary

In this episode, retired Lt. Col. Karen Kwiatkowski joins Groong to break down the so-called ‚Äú12-Day War‚Äù between Israel and Iran‚Äîtriggered by Israeli assassinations and escalated by Trump‚Äôs sudden military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Kwiatkowski critiques Israel‚Äôs lawless war conduct, the silence of Congress, and Trump‚Äôs attempt to fold the war into his ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù agenda. She argues that Iran, paradoxically, emerged stronger on the world stage, while Israel‚Äôs internal cohesion and credibility have been damaged. The conversation also touches on the collapse of the U.S. peace movement, the manipulation of American foreign policy by Israeli interests, and the erosion of trust between Trump and his populist base.

### **Main Topics Addressed**
- The ‚Äú12-Day War‚Äù between Israel and Iran: timeline, tactics, and the fragile ceasefire.
- Trump‚Äôs redefinition of ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù to justify war participation.
- Israel‚Äôs broader strategic objectives and impact on its internal politics.
- Fallout for Iran‚Äôs nuclear program and implications for multipolar diplomacy.
- Erosion of U.S. anti-war movements and constitutional norms.

### **Key Questions Discussed**
- Will the ceasefire between Israel and Iran hold‚Äîand why was Trump so confident it would?
- Who really won this war‚Äîand how did the Global South react?
- Did Trump‚Äôs bombing campaign actually eliminate Iran‚Äôs nuclear threat, or was it mostly symbolic?
- Is regime change in Iran still a real objective for Israel and the U.S.?
- Has Trump lost trust with his own base, or will the MAGA movement absorb this pivot to war?
- Why has the U.S. peace movement gone silent‚Äîand what does this say about American democracy?
