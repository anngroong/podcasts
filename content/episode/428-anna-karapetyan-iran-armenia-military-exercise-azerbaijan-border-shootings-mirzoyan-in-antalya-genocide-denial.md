## Thoughts from the Participants
* **Hovik**: Aftermath of Gyumri elections: opposition consolidating, but concerns of government retaliation persist.
* **Anna**: Government forcing new “Citizens Day” holiday on people. Pretty much around the time of the Armenian Genocide.
* **Asbed**: Pathetic Armenian performance at the Antalya Diplomatic Forum. Is Pashinyan’s “real Armenia” tomorrow’s “western Azerbaijan”?
