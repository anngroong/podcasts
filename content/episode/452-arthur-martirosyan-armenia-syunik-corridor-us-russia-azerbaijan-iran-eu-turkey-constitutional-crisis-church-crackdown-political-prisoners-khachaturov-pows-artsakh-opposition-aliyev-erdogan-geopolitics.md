## Main Topics Addressed
- **Constitution Day**: Pashinyan’s rejection of Armenia’s founding document and what it signals
- **Foreign-Controlled Corridor through Syunik**: From rejecting a Russian corridor to considering a U.S.-managed one
- **Kaja Kallas in Yerevan**: What message did the Estonian PM and EU envoy bring to Armenia?
- **Russia-Azerbaijan Breakdown**: Arrests, beatings, media retaliation, and geopolitical friction
- **Church Crackdown**: Samvel Karapetyan’s arrest and surveillance of clergy raise alarm
- **Stripping of Parliamentary Immunity**: Ohanyan and Minasyan face charges over years-old land case
- **Turkey's Latest Insult**: Talaat Pasha’s name proposed for border crossing amid "normalization"
- **SCO Application Confusion**: Armenia seeks membership in a bloc that includes many CSTO allies, and is incompatible with EU aspirations

## Key Questions Discussed
- Has Armenia surrendered the principle of sovereignty by inviting U.S. oversight in Syunik?
- Why is Erdogan praising Armenia’s “constructive” stance on the Zangezur corridor?
- What’s behind Russia’s sudden crackdown on Azerbaijani-linked criminal figures—and Baku’s aggressive response?
- Are the criminal charges against Ohanyan and Minasyan politically timed and selectively applied?
- What does Turkey’s proposal to name a border crossing after Talaat Pasha say about Armenian-Turkish normalization?
- Is Armenia’s application to the SCO a realistic foreign policy shift or just more confusion?

## Thoughts from the Participants
- **Arthur**: Reflected on the **nationalization of Electric Networks of Armenia (ENA)** and the strategic significance of Armenia’s **electrical infrastructure**, including the potential for **AI data centers** and cross-border power export.
- **Hovik**: Criticized **AUA’s handling of student activism**, raising concerns about the university’s values and its role in **suppressing free speech** during recent protests.

## The Kitchen Sink
- **Opposition Immunity Stripped**: Ohanyan and Minasyan were charged over a land deal from years ago, even though the same property was previously attributed to Ohanyan’s wife. Meanwhile, **Khachatur Sukiasyan**, a regime-aligned oligarch with a long record of suspicious deals, remains untouched.
- **Talaat Pasha Crossing**: Turkey’s proposal to rename a border crossing after the chief architect of the Armenian Genocide is a humiliating blow amid Pashinyan’s push for normalization.
- **Artsakh Parliament in Exile**: With Davit Ishkhanyan detained in Baku, **Ashot Danielyan** was named Speaker and acting president by the Artsakh National Assembly in exile.
- **SCO Membership Bid**: Armenia’s announcement that it is applying to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, despite having burned bridges with CSTO members, adds another layer of strategic confusion.
