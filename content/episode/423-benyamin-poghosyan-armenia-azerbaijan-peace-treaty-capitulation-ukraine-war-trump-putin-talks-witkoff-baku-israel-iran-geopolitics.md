## **Topics Covered**  

### **1. Armenia-Azerbaijan “Peace” Agreement: Concessions or Capitulation?**  
- **Background**: Since the November 9-10, 2020 ceasefire statement, Azerbaijan has dictated terms to Armenia, often using military force or threats. The latest development is the March 13 announcement of a finalized **peace agreement**, though many in Armenia see it as a **capitulation**.  
- **The Announcement**: Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov announced on March 13 that the **text of the agreement** was finalized. Armenia confirmed it later, claiming the announcement was supposed to be joint.  
- **Lack of Transparency**: The treaty text remains undisclosed to the public, prompting Armenian opposition groups to label it a **surrender document**.  

### **2. Azerbaijan’s Preconditions and Threats of Military Force**  
- **Unilateral Demands**: Azerbaijan has attached preconditions before signing the treaty, including:  
  - **Dissolution of the OSCE Minsk Group**, effectively erasing Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) from international negotiations.  
  - **Constitutional changes in Armenia**, removing references to the Armenian Genocide and Artsakh.  
- **Ramping Up Ceasefire Accusations**: Following the treaty announcement, Azerbaijan has escalated claims of **Armenian ceasefire violations**, issuing **three accusations on March 16 and three more on March 17**.  
- **What This Means**: These demands and escalations indicate that **Azerbaijan may not intend to sign the agreement soon**, instead using delays as leverage for further concessions.  

### **3. The Ukraine War and Trump-Putin Negotiations**  
- **Jeddah Ceasefire Talks**: Ukraine and Russia held peace negotiations in Jeddah last week.  
- **Largest Ever UAV Attack**: The talks were overshadowed by **Ukraine’s biggest drone attack on Russian cities**, increasing tensions.  
- **Steve Witkoff’s Moscow Visit**: U.S. Special Envoy **Steve Witkoff** met **Putin** following the Jeddah talks.  
- **Ceasefire Proposal**: Putin did not immediately accept a ceasefire but left room for further **negotiations**.  
- **Trump-Putin Call Scheduled for March 18**: A pivotal phone call is set between **Trump and Putin**, reportedly to discuss land divisions and control over key **power plants**.  

### **4. Europe’s Escalation and Militarization**  
- **France & UK’s Position**: European rhetoric against Russia is hardening, with talk of rearmament.  
- **Military Build-up**: Germany is considering converting **Volkswagen factories into tank production facilities**.  
- **UK’s Ground Troops Proposal**: The UK has hinted at sending **ground troops to Ukraine**, further raising tensions.  

### **5. The Curious Witkoff Stopover in Baku**  
- **Unusual Visit**: On his way back from Moscow, Witkoff made an **unpublicized stop in Baku**.  
- **Speculation on Israel & Iran**:  
  - **Azerbaijan-Israel ties** are deepening, with reports that **Azerbaijan’s state oil company, SOCAR, has entered a deal for Israeli gas fields**.  
  - Discussions may have included **potential Azerbaijani involvement in a future conflict with Iran**.  
  - Some sources speculate that **Azerbaijan might be pushed to join the Abraham Accords**, normalizing ties with Israel and Saudi Arabia.
