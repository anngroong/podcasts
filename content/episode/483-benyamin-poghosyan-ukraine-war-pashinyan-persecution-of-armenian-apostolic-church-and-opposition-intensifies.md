# Groong Week in Review, Ep 483 — Show Notes

# Summary
Dr. Benyamin Poghosyan joins us and We cover the Ukraine war’s trajectory and why a simple “freeze” only defers conflict, review US–Russia dynamics under Trump, and consider how a China focus and possible Venezuela moves could affect Armenia. We examine Pashinyan’s confrontation with the Armenian Church and the wave of opposition detentions, then dig into border demarcation, possible enclave trades, and Baku’s “Western Azerbaijan” rhetoric. We also discuss a second-track meeting in Yerevan that included Artsakh-blockade figures, and Pashinyan's new “Police Guard” plan.

# Main Topics Addressed
- Ukraine war scenarios, manpower, timelines, and why a bare ceasefire is unstable  
- US–Russia relations under Trump, Europe’s role, and a China-first priority set  
- Church–state clash in Armenia, arrests near the Catholicos, and political timing  
- Demarcation and enclaves, and the risk of false “equivalence” with 2021–22 incursions  
- “Western Azerbaijan” narrative and settlement pressure on Armenia  
- A second-track meeting in Yerevan that included a Lachin blockade participant  
- The “Police Guard” concept and civil-liberties concerns

# Key Questions Discussed
- If the front “freezes,” what happens next, and who benefits  
- How far Trump can steer Europe or Zelensky, and how a China focus shapes choices  
- What Pashinyan’s endgame is with the Church, and whether identity engineering is at work  
- Whether Armenia will concede enclaves, and how to avoid false “equivalence” with 2021–22 incursions  
- How serious Aliyev is about settling Azerbaijanis in Armenia, and on what timeline  
- What confidence-building means if invitees helped blockade Artsakh

# Thoughts from the Participants
- **Benyamin:** Be cautious after August 2025, weigh threats, and avoid wishful thinking as Armenia heads toward 2026.  
- **Hovik:** Concern over limited and ambiguous backing from Antelias for the Catholicos amid church pressures.  
- **Asbed:** Recommended the film *House of Dynamite* a modern take on nuclear-crisis risk, as a cautionary lens on current tensions.
