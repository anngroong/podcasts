# Show Notes

In this Conversations on Groong episode, we speak with Ambassador Alberto M. Fernandez about the Vatican’s collaboration with Azerbaijan, particularly the recent conference held at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome that attempted to whitewash the ethnic cleansing of Armenians from Artsakh. Fernandez shares his critique of the Vatican’s role in legitimizing authoritarian propaganda, and we also explore the muted international response to Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, the implications of Armenia’s shifting diplomatic posture, and how Trump’s return to the White House could affect regional dynamics in the South Caucasus and the Middle East.
