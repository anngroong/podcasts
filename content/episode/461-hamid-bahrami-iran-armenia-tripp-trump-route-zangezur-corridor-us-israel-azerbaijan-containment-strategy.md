In this episode, analyst **Hamid Bahrami** joins us to discuss Iran’s recalibrating role in the South Caucasus following the White House meeting between Trump, Pashinyan, and Aliyev that unveiled the TRIPP corridor, or “Trump Route.” We explore how the project threatens to bypass and encircle Iran, its possible link to a wider US-Israeli strategy, and the risks of a new regional war. The discussion also covers Iran’s past passivity in the Caucasus, the wake-up call of the 44-day war, and Tehran’s options for deeper cooperation with Russia, China, and Armenia as it faces a shifting geopolitical order.

# Main Topics Addressed
- The White House meeting: Trump secures 99-year rights to the TRIPP corridor, Armenia and Azerbaijan initial a peace agreement, and Section 907 is promised to be canceled.  
- Iran’s mixed reaction compared to Russia’s muted stance, and what this means for Tehran’s regional strategy.  
- TRIPP as part of a wider US-Israel plan to weaken and encircle Iran, with parallels to ongoing war threats in the Middle East.  
- Iran’s long-standing passivity in the northern vector, shaped by concerns over ethnic Azeris and reliance on Russia.  
- The 44-day war and Israel’s growing role in Azerbaijan as a turning point for Iranian security thinking.  
- Possible future: Iran-Armenia cooperation beyond symbolic gestures, into logistics, intelligence, and military depth.  
- Armenia’s uncertain political outlook ahead of 2026 elections and its ability to become a reliable security partner.

# Key Questions Discussed
- How does TRIPP affect Iran’s national security compared to the original “Zangezur Corridor”?  
- Is the corridor part of a broader NATO/US strategy to encircle Iran and cut it off from Russia and the Black Sea?  
- What lessons did Tehran draw from decades of passivity and the outcome of the 44-day war?  
- Can Iran’s Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Russia evolve into deeper defense integration?  
- How should Iran approach Armenia now that Russia’s role is diminished?  
- Could Tehran fill the vacuum in Armenia with real operational presence, rather than symbolic diplomacy?  
- How do upcoming Armenian elections affect the feasibility of stronger Iran-Armenia ties?
