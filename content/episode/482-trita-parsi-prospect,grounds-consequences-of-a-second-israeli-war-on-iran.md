+++

A deep dive with Dr. Trita Parsi on whether Israel will strike Iran again, why June’s war left “unfinished business,” how much Israel depends on the United States, what Iran’s rapid-response playbook looks like after June, and how a wider fight could spill into the South Caucasus and affect Armenia. Recorded Oct 30, 2025. 

### Main Topics Addressed

* Timing and intent for an Israel–Iran clash. 
* Unfinished business from the June war. 
* The US role, limited support or full entry. 
* Iran’s escalation ladder and Caucasus spillover scenarios. 

### Key Questions Discussed

* Does the December timetable still hold, and what could cancel the war outright. 
* What Israel would need to achieve in the first 48 hours to claim success. 
* Can Washington avoid being dragged in, and what thresholds shift a limited role to full entry. 
* How ready Iran is, what rungs exist on its escalation ladder, and what a Hormuz disruption would mean. 
* How a war could spill into the South Caucasus, including Armenia’s exposure and US moves in the region.
