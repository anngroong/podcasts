In this conversation, we speak with Dr. Arman Grigoryan about the rapidly escalating war between Israel, the United States, and Iran. We explore the strategic goals behind the conflict, the risks of nuclear escalation, and whether regime change or the partitioning of Iran is a realistic objective—or a dangerous delusion. We also examine how Russia, China, and Europe are responding, and why Iran’s survival or collapse could reshape Armenia’s geopolitical position. Finally, we discuss how Armenia might navigate the fallout of a regional war it cannot afford to ignore.

### Main Topics Addressed
- Israel's and the U.S.'s strategic aims in the war on Iran  
- Risks of regional escalation and the possibility of nuclear weapons use  
- Strategic consequences of Iranian collapse or survival for Armenia  
- Russia and China’s limited involvement and balancing calculations  

### Key Questions Discussed
- Is regime change the real goal behind the Iran war?  
- Can Iran count on meaningful support from Russia or China?  
- Is Europe now irrelevant in Middle East diplomacy?  
- What are the risks to Armenia if Iran is defeated—or partitioned?  
- How might Iran’s outcomes strengthen or weaken Armenia’s regional position?
