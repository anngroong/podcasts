In this episode, Armenian MP Arthur Khachatryan joins Groong to discuss the publication of his two-volume work on the Artsakh negotiations and the unfolding political crisis in Armenia. He challenges key narratives pushed by the current Armenian government, especially those related to the fate of Artsakh and the peace process. The conversation covers the suppression of Artsakh-related discourse, efforts to sideline the Armenian Church, the state’s aggressive moves to nationalize Samvel Karapetyan’s assets, and the deepening authoritarian streak under Pashinyan. Khachatryan provides historical and legal context to refute claims by the ruling regime and reflects on what may lie ahead politically, including the potential banning of opposition parties like the ARF.
