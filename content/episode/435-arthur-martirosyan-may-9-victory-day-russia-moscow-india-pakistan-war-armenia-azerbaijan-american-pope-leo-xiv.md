## Summary

In this Week in Review episode, we sit down with Arthur G. Martirosyan, a conflict management expert, to discuss the broader implications of Victory Day in Moscow, where Xi Jinping’s presence underscored China’s growing influence and Trump’s push for a US-centric WWII holiday sparked controversy. We explore Armenia’s shifting narrative through a controversial interview aired on Public TV and the contrasting approaches of Armenia and Azerbaijan to the parade. The episode also delves into escalating tensions between India and Pakistan, Trump’s proposed ceasefire in Ukraine, and the implications of the election of the first American Pope for the Armenian Church.

## Main Topics Addressed:
- **Victory Day in Moscow:** Xi Jinping’s presence, EU leaders’ attendance despite pressure, and Trump’s proposed US-centric Victory Day.
- **Armenia and Azerbaijan’s differing approaches to Victory Day:** Pashinyan attends but does not send troops; Aliyev skips the event but sends a contingent.
- **Historical Narratives in Armenia:** Armenia’s Public TV airs a prime-time interview with Artsrun Hovhannisyan challenging post-Soviet narratives.
- **Russia-Ukraine Conflict:** New missile strikes; Trump threatens sweeping sanctions to force a ceasefire.
- **India-Pakistan Tensions:** Drone warfare, missile strikes, and Trump’s ceasefire announcement amid ongoing violations.
- **Regional Alliances:** Turkey and Azerbaijan back Pakistan; Israel aligns with India; implications for Armenia and Iran.
- **Armenia-Azerbaijan Peace Talks:** Pashinyan and Armenian officials suggest an imminent peace deal as border clashes persist.
- **New Pope Leo XIV:** First American Pope elected; implications for the Armenian Church and its engagement with the Vatican.

## Key Questions Discussed:
- How is Russia using Victory Day to signal its alignment with emerging powers like China and the Global South?
- Is Trump’s proposed US-centric Victory Day part of a broader effort to rewrite WWII narratives and reinforce American exceptionalism?
- How significant is the divergence between Armenia and Azerbaijan’s approach to Victory Day in Moscow?
- What is the impact of Trump’s push for a ceasefire in Ukraine on the ongoing conflict and regional stability?
- Can Armenia leverage shifting alliances amid the India-Pakistan conflict to its advantage?
- What is the real state of the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace talks amid continued border clashes?
- How might the new Pope Leo XIV influence the Vatican’s stance on Armenian issues, considering its recent engagement with Azerbaijan?
