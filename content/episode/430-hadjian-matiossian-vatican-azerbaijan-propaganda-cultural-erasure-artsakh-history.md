# Show Notes

In this Conversations on Groong episode, we discuss the Vatican's controversial collaboration with Azerbaijan to whitewash the erasure of Armenian history.

In the final weeks of Pope Francis' life, the Pontifical Gregorian University hosted a conference titled *"Christianity in Azerbaijan: History and Modernity,"* backed by Azerbaijan’s regime. The event, with no Armenian participation, advanced a false narrative erasing the Christian Armenian heritage of Artsakh.

We are joined by:
- **Avedis Hadjian**, journalist and co-author of the letter signed by over 350 scholars condemning the Vatican’s complicity.
- **Dr. Vartan Matiossian**, historian, Executive Director of the Eastern Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church of New York, and a co-author of the letter.

Together, we examine how the Vatican’s actions fit into a larger pattern of corruption, Azerbaijani propaganda, and the troubling silence of the Armenian state.
