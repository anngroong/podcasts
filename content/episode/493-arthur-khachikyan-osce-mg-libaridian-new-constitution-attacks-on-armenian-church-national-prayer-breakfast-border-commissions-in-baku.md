## A response to @jacobpursley1800 

We address a comment from a user “@jacobpursley1800”, responding to our [Episode 490](https://youtu.be/BGnt2feIXMs) with Joel Veldkamp, of the Christian Solidarity International, about Armenia’s national prayer breakfast. 

Comment screenshot:

Pursley says the event was not organized by the Armenian government, the Prime Minister did not host it, and that our take was not “fact based.”

While the main topic of our show was the persecution of the Armenian Apostolic Church and its clergy, which the commenter completely sidestepped, we would like to address the matter of whether this event was truly organized by an independent “civil society” without any help from the government.

1. Who was the prayer breakfast organized by?

There were other co-organizers, but the main coordinator of the event is Stepan Sargsyan from the “Individual Believers Club” as the commenter also indicates.

2. Who is Stepan Sargsyan?

Stepan Sargsyan is listed as a ***“member of the central committee of the ‘Education is Fashionable’ movement and project manager”***.

3. Education is Fashionable is a program under the aegis of [My Step Foundation](https://mystep.foundation/en/programs/education-is-fashionable/) which is an ‘NGO’ founded by Nikol Pashinyan’s partner, Anna Hakobyan and affiliated with Civil Contract.

* Chair of the Board of Trustees is Lena Nazaryan, a member of the Civil Contract party.
* Executive Director is Anna Hakobyan, Nikol Pashinyan’s partner.

4. According to [media](https://factor.am/902451.html), Education is Fashionable is also funded by the state budget and the amount of funding is concealed as a ‘state secret’
