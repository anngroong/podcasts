In this episode of **Conversations on Groong**, we examine why Venezuela has returned to the center of global geopolitics. The discussion focuses on oil, sanctions, and military pressure, and how a potential revival of Venezuelan production could reshape energy markets, weaken Russia and Iran, strain OPEC+, and alter the dynamics of ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.

### Topics Covered

- Harry Istepanian’s background and expertise in global energy markets  
- Venezuela’s oil reserves and the collapse of production after sanctions  
- The role of US sanctions, expelled oil companies, and low US strategic reserves  
- Washington’s pressure campaign on Venezuela and regional reactions  
- Trump’s push for oil prices below 50 dollars per barrel  
- OPEC+ price discipline and the threat of Venezuelan supply returning  
- The impact of cheaper oil on Russia’s war budget in Ukraine  
- Consequences for Iran, Iraq, and Gulf state economies  
- Risks of escalation in the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz

### Key Questions Discussed

- Why did Venezuela’s oil production collapse so sharply over the past decade?  
- How low is the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and why does it matter now?  
- Why does Trump see Venezuelan oil as a strategic problem rather than a commercial one?  
- What prevents US oil companies from returning to Venezuela quickly?  
- How would a surge in Venezuelan oil challenge OPEC+ and global price controls?  
- What happens to Russia’s economy and war financing if oil prices fall sharply?  
- How would Iran and Gulf states respond to sustained price pressure?  
- Could new Venezuelan supply change the balance in global conflicts?  
- What Middle East risks could still override a rise in oil supply?
