In this episode we examine the erosion of democratic norms across the South Caucasus. We discuss Azerbaijan’s ongoing war crimes, the sham trials of former Artsakh leaders, and the silence of Western institutions such as the OSCE. We also look at Armenia’s internal political crackdowns, the rise of pre-trial detentions, and the government’s widening campaign against the Armenian Church. Our guest, **Garen Jinbachian** of ANCA-WR, shares insights from the OSCE Human Dimension Conference and his broader human rights advocacy work.
