Anna Grigoryan joins us to assess four Armenians returning from Baku amid continued detention of other POWs, the escalating clash between Nikol Pashinyan’s government and the Armenian Apostolic Church, new details around TRIPP after talks in Washington, and what is at stake in Armenia’s June 2026 elections, including opposition strategy and outside influence.

## Main Topics Addressed

### 1) Return of 4 Hostages
- What the release signals, and why the continued detention of at least 19 Armenians remains the core issue
- Criticism of the terms and timing, including concerns about “hostage diplomacy” during negotiations
- The reported linkage to Armenia returning two Syrian mercenaries, and Pashinyan’s denial that this was an exchange
- Prior precedents of releasing convicted enemy personnel, and what that suggests about state policy and deterrence

### 2) Pashinyan vs. Church
- Why the dispute matters beyond personalities, and what it means for church autonomy and state neutrality
- Claims of external pressure and the wider pattern of state control over institutions
- Legal and constitutional questions raised by government and security-service involvement
- Political implications, including polling signals about social cohesion and trusted public figures
- Possible offramps that reduce social tension without granting blanket impunity

### 3) TRIPP
- What the Washington agreements suggest about the project’s logistics and direction
- How TRIPP overlaps with the November 2020 ceasefire framework, with a different external sponsor
- Likely effects on Russia and Iran’s interests, and how they might respond

### 4) Upcoming Elections (June 2026)
- What is at stake, and which themes may drive the campaign, including Artsakh
- Why opposition ratings trail the ruling party, and what it would take to win
- Hayastan Dashinq’s record over the past five years, including strengths and gaps
- Debate over “new faces” versus “formers,” and what that means for coalition-building
- Alliance options (Mer Dzevov, Wings of Unity), and Anna Grigoryan’s own plans
- External signaling, including claims of Turkish and EU support for Pashinyan
- Whether Russia still views Pashinyan as an “acceptable” outcome, and what may have changed since 2021

## Key Questions Discussed

### Return of 4 Hostages
- How should Armenia read the timing and intent of these releases?
- Do you expect more releases before June 2026, and on what terms?
- If this was not an exchange, why did the releases line up the same day?
- What message does prior prisoner release policy send to Baku, and to Armenian society?

### Pashinyan vs. Church
- Is this driven by geopolitics, domestic politics, or personal conflict?
- Why has the opposition not pursued impeachment or Constitutional Court action for alleged unconstitutional conduct?
- What negotiated offramps could cool the conflict?
- How can society restore harmony without rewarding abuses by any side?

### TRIPP
- How strong is the deal Armenia’s team negotiated with the Trump administration?
- What are the second-order effects for Russia and Iran, and how might they push back?

### June 2026 Elections
- What are the core stakes, and will Artsakh become a defining issue?
- What must the broad opposition spectrum do differently to compete?
- What should we expect in Hayastan Dashinq’s makeup as elections near?
- Has external support for Pashinyan changed since 2021, and how does Russia factor now?
