# summary
Philippe Raffi Kalfayan argues that “America First” has turned the U.S. into a harder, more transactional power toward Europe, and that Europe is exposed because it still lacks unified defense and foreign policy capacity. The discussion then moves to JD Vance’s reported Armenia stop and the TRIPP, which Kalfayan frames as a long-horizon corridor project that may be “secured” without securing Armenia, with unclear beneficiaries and success conditions Armenia does not fully control. The episode also covers Azerbaijan’s leverage, pressure tied to “returns” narratives, hostages in Baku, and the broader strain between Pashinyan and the Armenian Church, all set against Europe’s limited willingness to pay real costs for Armenia.

# Main Topics Addressed
- Why Trump-era U.S. policy is unpopular in Europe, and why that matters for Europe’s security posture
- Europe’s structural limits (defense, foreign policy, and accountability gaps)
- U.S. goals vis-a-vis Russia and China (and the risks for Europeans)
- JD Vance’s Armenia visit as signal, and what Armenia should assume (and not assume) from it
- TRIPP mechanics and sovereignty risk (control, concession logic, beneficiaries, enforcement)
- The “asset protection” model (corridor security versus state security)
- Azerbaijan’s leverage, “return” narratives, and pressure tactics
- Hostages in Baku, and the limits of Western leverage
- Pashinyan vs the Armenian Church, and how internal conflict intersects with geopolitics
- Europe–Armenia ties, incentives, and where rhetoric diverges from action

# Key Questions Discussed
- Why is the current U.S. posture so unpopular in Europe, and is it a long-term shift?
- Can Europe act as a strategic actor without unified defense and foreign policy tools?
- What does Vance’s visit suggest about U.S. priorities in Armenia and the region?
- Does TRIPP increase Armenia’s security, or mainly protect a route and its operators?
- Who really controls TRIPP, and why do “ultimate beneficiaries” matter?
- If TRIPP depends on peace with Azerbaijan and normalization with Turkey, who holds leverage?
- What can the West realistically demand from Baku regarding Armenian hostages?
- How does the Pashinyan–Church conflict change Armenia’s negotiating position?
