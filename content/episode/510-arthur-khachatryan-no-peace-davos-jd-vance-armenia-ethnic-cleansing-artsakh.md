# Summary

At Davos, Mark Carney’s blunt comment that the “rules-based international order” is a myth set the tone for a wider discussion about how small states survive in a system where rules get enforced selectively. From there, our discussion with __MP Arthur Khachatryan__  moved to Washington’s announced visit to Armenia and Azerbaijan by VP JD Vance and the TRIPP framing, including what it signals for Armenia’s strategic direction, and how Iran and Russia may react. In further topics, we focused on Armenia’s Church-state crisis (including the bishops’ assembly moving to Austria and the Talin liturgy incident), the last known Armenians leaving Artsakh, and the emergence of a new opposition force tied to the Mer Dzevov movement ahead of the June elections.

---

# Main Topics Addressed

### Davos and the “rules-based order” myth
- Why public admissions about selective enforcement matter, especially for small states.
- Armenia’s post-2020 reality check, and what “rules” mean when power decides outcomes.
- How Pashinyan uses “world order collapse” as an explanation for domestic failures.

### U.S. signaling: Vance trip, TRIPP framing, and regional blowback
- What the announced Armenia-Azerbaijan visit suggests about U.S. priorities.
- The logic and risks of TRIPP in a context defined by Iran and Russia’s red lines.
- Practical questions about “cooperation” headlines (energy, tech, nuclear) versus leverage realities.

### Armenian Church pressure campaign and institutional rupture
- The bishops’ assembly moving to St. Pölten, Austria, and why that is historically notable.
- The “church reform council” pushback and internal church politics.
- The Talin episode and the pattern of coercion around worship spaces.

### Mer Dzevov and the “Strong Armenia” party
- How Samvel Karapetyan’s case became a political catalyst.
- What “Strong Armenia” could mean for opposition alignment, vote splitting, and coalition math.

---

# Key Questions Discussed
- If the “rules-based order” is not real in practice, what should Armenia’s baseline strategy be?
- What could Armenia have done differently in 2020–2023 given structural power limits?
- Does the announced U.S. agenda treat Armenia as a partner, a corridor, or a bargaining chip?
- How tolerable is open TRIPP messaging for Iran and Russia, and what risks land on Armenia first?
- What should Armenians expect from U.S. officials on political prisoners, clergy arrests, and hostages in Baku?
- Does holding the bishops’ assembly abroad signal escalation, defensive adaptation, or both?
- What is “Strong Armenia,” who is it meant to mobilize, and can opposition forces coordinate for June?
