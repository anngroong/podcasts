# **Summary**
This episode looks at Trump’s foreign policy ten months into his term. We discuss the widening gap between the America First promise and the reality of new foreign fronts, including Venezuela, Ukraine, Gaza, and the TRIPP project in Armenia. Matt Hoh joins us to explain how these issues connect and what they reveal about Washington’s strategic direction.

---

# **Main Topics Addressed**

* Trump’s move to shut down Venezuelan airspace and the risk of escalation
* The shift in the Ukraine war and the gap between battlefield reality and media coverage
* The Gaza ceasefire, Trump’s 20-point plan, and the growing divide inside the America First base
* The TRIPP route in Armenia and the long-term strategic cost for the region
* How these foreign engagements challenge the core idea of America First

---

# **Key Questions Discussed**

* Why is Washington pushing toward confrontation with **Venezuela**, and what strategy is behind it?
* Why is there a major disconnect between official warnings on the **Ukraine war** and what appears in mainstream coverage?
* What is Trump’s actual goal in **Gaza**, and do these actions serve any defined U.S. national interest?
* Why is the **America First** movement splitting over foreign involvement?
* Does the **TRIPP** deal align with America First, and is the U.S. prepared for a 50 or 100-year commitment in the South Caucasus?
* Does Armenia matter to Washington beyond its value in pressuring Russia and Iran?
