In this episode of **Conversations on Groong**, we speak with Dr. Archil Sikharulidze about the deepening rift between Georgia and the European Union following the EU Parliament’s July 2025 resolution threatening sanctions, SWIFT disconnection, and political interference. We explore Georgia’s strategic importance in the South Caucasus, its balancing act between East and West, the growing pressure on traditional religious institutions, and the stakes surrounding Georgia’s upcoming municipal elections.**

## Main Topics Addressed

- The European Parliament’s July 2025 resolution on Georgia and its coercive tone
- The EU’s geopolitical strategy in the South Caucasus and its pressures on Georgia
- Trade and diplomacy: Georgia’s growing ties with Iran and China
- The regional pattern of attacks on traditional Churches in Georgia and Armenia
- Georgia’s upcoming municipal elections and the EU’s attempts to shape internal political outcomes

## Key Questions Discussed

- What is the EU’s strategy in the South Caucasus, and how does Georgia fit in it?
- Is the EU pressuring Georgia out of concern for democracy—or to secure geopolitical leverage?
- Why does the EU oppose Georgia’s economic ties with Iran and China?
- What does the Anaklia port project symbolize in the context of EU–Georgia relations?
- Why is the Georgian Orthodox Church—and the Armenian Apostolic Church—under attack?
- Does joining the EU require giving up national identity and traditional institutions?
- What’s at stake in the 2025 municipal elections, and how are they being positioned as a referendum on Georgia’s legitimacy?
