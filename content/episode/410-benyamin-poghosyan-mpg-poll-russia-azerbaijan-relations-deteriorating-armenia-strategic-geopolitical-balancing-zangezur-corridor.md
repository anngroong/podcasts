## Thoughts from the Participants
* **Hovik**: 70-year-old Artsakh refugee Gharib Babayan video exposes Azeris in central Yerevan celebrating destruction of Artsakh, and gets arrested for “inciting ethnic hatred.” Armenia is an occupied country.
* **Benyamin**: Changes in the US precipitating transformation of the post-unipolar world.
