This episode features political scientist Andrei Tsygankov on his new book *Canceling Russia*, the Western shift from “containment” to “coercive transformation,” and how the “towers of the Kremlin” shape Russian foreign policy. The discussion also examines the “state-civilization” concept, civilizational competition around Russia, and whether today’s “might makes right” climate could push Russia toward a more unilateral, jungle-rules approach.

## Main Topics Addressed
- “Canceling Russia” as a mass-scale political and cultural campaign
- Western strategy shift: containment to coercive transformation
- The “cancel Russia lobby” and the role of think tanks
- Trump’s approach to Russia and Europe’s burden-sharing
- The Russian Orthodox Church as a geopolitical and information battleground
- How Russian foreign policy is made (the “towers of the Kremlin”)
- “State-civilization” and civilizational discourse
- Degradation of the international order into “law of the jungle”
- Whether Russia could adopt a more unilateral style

## Key Questions Discussed
- How did “Canceling Russia” begin, and how is it sustained?
- How has canceling affected academia and scholarship, including the guest’s experience?
- What explains the West’s policy trajectory from containment to coercive transformation?
- When and why did the window for coexistence close, if it did?
- Who makes up the “cancel Russia lobby,” and how does it function?
- What role do think tanks play in shaping the agenda and narrative?
- How should Trump’s Russia policy be read, real shift or tactical adjustment?
- How does pressure on the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine serve wider aims, and what risks follow?
- How do “towers of the Kremlin” shape policy signals and red lines?
- In Ukraine, were Moscow’s red lines misread, dismissed, or judged irrational?
- What does “state-civilization” mean internally vs. externally?
- Is it compatible with Huntington-style civilizational blocs?
- Why has “international order” weakened into raw power politics?
- Could Russia evolve toward a more unilateral “might makes right” posture beyond Ukraine?
