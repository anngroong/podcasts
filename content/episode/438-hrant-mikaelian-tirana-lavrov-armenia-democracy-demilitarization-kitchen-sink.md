# **Main Topics Addressed**

- **Pashinyan in Tirana**: Very little was shared in advance about his meetings with Erdogan and Aliyev; post-meeting reports reveal renewed demands, including the removal of Mt. Ararat from Armenia’s coat of arms. European leaders echoed calls for a "swift" peace deal.
- **Lavrov’s Visit to Yerevan**: Russia aims to stay relevant in normalization talks; seeks presence, not outcomes.
- **Crackdown on Journalism**: Armenian journalists face persecution; authorities draft new anti-media laws.
- **Municipal Corruption & Political Decline**: Tigran Avinyan allies arrested; public confidence in Yerevan city leadership slipping.
- **Election 2026 and Opposition Rifts**: Kocharian eyes a comeback; factions split between elections and impeachment.
- **Military Reform = Demilitarization?**: $52,000 bill to shorten service seen as quiet demilitarization.
- **The Kitchen Sink Segment**: Follow-ups on Iran-Armenia ties, parliament chaos, and defense import cuts.

# **Key Questions Discussed**

- What exactly are Aliyev’s expanding demands, and why does the West appear complicit?
- Why is Pashinyan negotiating secretly with Erdogan while Turkey blockades Armenia?
- Can Lavrov’s visit restore Russia’s influence in Armenia, or is it just optics?
- Is Armenia’s military reform a step toward national weakening under external pressure?
- Why are Western civil society groups silent as press freedom erodes in Armenia?
- Can the Armenian opposition realistically unseat Pashinyan in 2026—or are they too fragmented?
