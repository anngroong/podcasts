## Thoughts from the Participants

- **Arthur:** A pro-Turkish candidate in the **Abkhazian elections** has emerged, and Turkey is mobilizing its diaspora. The lack of Armenian diplomatic engagement on this issue is concerning, as is Armenia's role in protecting Armenians abroad.  

- **Hovik:** **Edgar Ghazaryan‚Äôs** satirical show **"Ghazaryan vs. Ghazaryan"**,  parodies Armenian Public TV interviews and has gained more views than the original content.
