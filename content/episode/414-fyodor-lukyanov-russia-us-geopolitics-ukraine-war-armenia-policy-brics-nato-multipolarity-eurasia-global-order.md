## Main Topics Addressed  

- **A New Détente? Russia-US relations and evolving global dynamics**  
  Do the recent shifts in US foreign policy, particularly under the Trump administration, indicate a move toward a new détente between Washington and Moscow? Lukyanov analyzed the broader geopolitical landscape, including US domestic politics, NATO’s role, and how different power centers perceive the idea of global stability.  

- **The Trump-Putin Call and its implications for Ukraine**  
  During the highly anticipated Trump-Putin phone call key US policy positions on Ukraine were subtly adjusted. Trump’s remarks on Ukraine’s NATO prospects, the feasibility of a negotiated settlement, and whether Russia perceives this as a sincere effort toward peace or merely a political maneuver. Also,  the possibility of sanctions relief and the role of European actors in any future negotiations.  

- **Russia’s Strategic Choices: BRICS, G8, and multipolarity**  
  Russia’s strategic positioning in the global order. Trump has reportedly suggested that Russia should abandon BRICS and return to the G8, raising questions about Moscow’s long-term vision. Why Russia has moved toward a multipolar world vision and why it sees BRICS as a necessary vehicle for reducing Western financial influence, particularly in de-dollarization efforts.

- **Russo-Armenian Relations and Armenia’s geopolitical shift**
  The deteriorating relationship between Armenia and Russia under Nikol Pashinyan’s leadership. Discussion included Armenia’s push toward European integration, its potential exit from the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), and how Moscow perceives these developments. Is  Armenia’s geopolitical realignment sustainable, and how Russia might respond to the changing dynamics in the South Caucasus?

- **The Zangezur Corridor and Azerbaijan’s regional ambitions**
  One of the most pressing regional security concerns is Azerbaijan’s claim over Syunik, framed as the "Zangezur Corridor." The discussion covered Baku’s military posturing, Turkey’s strategic backing, and Iran’s strong opposition, which it labels as “NATO’s Turan Corridor.” Lukyanov analyzed Russia’s position on the issue, whether Moscow views Syunik as a red line, and how this dispute fits into broader regional power struggles.

- **Georgia’s Pragmatism and its impact on Russia’s strategy**  
  Georgia has adopted a notably pragmatic approach toward Russia, avoiding direct confrontation while resisting Western pressure. How does this contrast with with Armenia’s approach? What lessons should Yerevan take from Tbilisi’s strategy? And how does Russia view the possibility of renewed ties with Georgia? Lukyanov also provided thoughts on Georgia’s economic and security calculus in the region.  

## Key Questions Discussed  
- Is Trump serious about ending the war in Ukraine, or is it just political maneuvering?  
- What are Russia’s red lines in any peace settlement?  
- Can the US and Russia reach a new détente?  
- Will Russia abandon BRICS and rejoin the G8?  
- How does Moscow view Pashinyan’s EU aspirations?  
- What is Russia’s position on Azerbaijan’s ambitions over Syunik and the “Zangezur Corridor”?  
- How does Georgia’s pragmatic approach shape its relations with Russia?
