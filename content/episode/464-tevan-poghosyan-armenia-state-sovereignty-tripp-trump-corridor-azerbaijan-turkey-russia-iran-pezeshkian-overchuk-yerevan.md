This Week in Review features Tevan Poghosyan, who joins us to discuss the 35th anniversary of Armenia’s Declaration of State Sovereignty, the secrecy and dangers surrounding the Washington-brokered TRIPP (Trump Route) agreements, Iran’s mixed response to the corridor following President Masoud Pezeshkian’s visit to Yerevan, and Russia’s quiet but firm reminders of its enduring leverage in Armenia. We also touch on the Gaza genocide, the importance of unity for Armenians, and developments in Armenian politics including Narek Karapetyan’s videos, Jirayr Libaridian’s analysis, Russia’s response to pro-Azeri voices, Pashinyan’s defense budget stance, and more in the Kitchen Sink.

# Key Questions Discussed
- What does Armenia’s sovereignty mean today, 35 years after its declaration?  
- Why is the Armenian government keeping the US-Armenia/TRIPP agreements secret?  
- What “security guarantees” can Armenia realistically expect from a U.S.-backed corridor?  
- Is Aliyev sincere about peace, given his rhetoric of revenge?  
- Did Pezeshkian leave Armenia with more questions than answers about Iran’s red lines?  
- How is Russia signaling its strategy while avoiding a new front with the West?  


# Thoughts from the Participants
- **Hovik:** The Gaza genocide continues, with aid weaponized through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, whose chairman is reportedly one David Papazian.
- **Tevan:** Remember and celebrate Artsakh Independence Day on September 2, so that Armenians will return one day.
- **Asbed:** Armenian unity is not optional, it is strategic for survival.

# Kitchen Sink
- **Narek Karapetyan’s Video Address** exposing inflated school construction costs.  
- **Jirayr Libaridian’s Article** echoing Pashinyan’s positions while ignoring Artsakh.  
- **Russia** cracking down on pro-Azeri pundits by labeling them foreign agents.  
- **Pashinyan** hiring U.S. lawyers to fight the Stockholm Arbitration Court ruling on ENA.  
- **Defense budget** cuts despite Azerbaijani buildup.  
- **Arsen Torosyan** resigns as MP, rumored to take another ministerial post.  
- **Trump’s gaffe** claiming to have ended conflict between “Azerbaijan and Albania.”
