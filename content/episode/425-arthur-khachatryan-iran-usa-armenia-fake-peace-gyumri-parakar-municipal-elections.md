# **Main Topics Addressed**
- Iran's rejection of U.S. offers for direct nuclear talks and its implications for Armenia.
- Strategic implications of Armenia's shift toward the EU, and its potential impact on ties with Iran and regional security.
- Local elections in Gyumri and Parakar, and their national political significance.
- Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) refugee protests in Yerevan over unmet social and political demands.
- Analysis of the so-called “peace process” between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

---

# **Key Questions Discussed**
- What are the regional consequences of Iran refusing direct U.S. negotiations but staying open to indirect talks?
- Could Armenia realistically pursue a military or political alliance with Iran? What are the trade-offs?
- How do the results of the Gyumri and Parakar municipal elections reflect shifts in Armenian political sentiment?
- What does the Armenian government's lack of response to Artsakh refugees suggest about its policy priorities?
- Is the Pashinyan administration’s proclaimed “peace deal” with Azerbaijan genuine or a political façade?
- What would a just and sustainable peace in the South Caucasus actually require?


# **Thoughts from the Participants**
* **Hovik**: The horror and inhumanity being suffered by the Palestinians in the hands of Israel, and to the cheers and encouragement of Western leaders.
* **Arthur**: A fair peace can only be achieved with the interests of both sides taken into account. With the current government’s attitude, the only peace will be in the cemetery. 
    * Book on Artsakh Negotiations Volume 1 out!
