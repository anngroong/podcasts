# Summary
With __Dr. Benyamin Poghosyan__ We cover Archbishop Mikayel Ajapahyan’s two-year sentence and what it signals in an lethargic Armenia, Moldova’s election and diaspora voting, the EU’s patterns of force ahead of Armenia’s 2026 vote, takeaways from the European Political Community (EPC) in Copenhagen and the Warsaw Security Forum (WSF), the politics of the U.S. PEACE Act, defense shifts including a shortened 18-month military service plan contrasted with acknowledged military serviceman shortage, and the internal fight over the stalled 44-day war report.

# Main Topics Addressed
- Ajapahyan sentencing and public apathy  
- Moldova vote, access issues, diaspora turnout  
- EU posture before Armenia’s 2026 elections  
- EPC Copenhagen and Warsaw takeaways  
- U.S. PEACE Act and speech risks  
- Defense budget and 18-month conscription  
- War report standoff in parliament

# Key Questions Discussed
- What goal does Ajapahyan’s verdict serve in today’s politics?  
- What lessons from Moldova matter for Armenia’s 2026 race?  
- How do EU timing and optics shape Armenia’s field?  
- Did EPC and Warsaw deliver anything concrete?  
- How could the PEACE Act affect speech and politics in Armenia?  
- What trade-offs come with conscription cuts and budget shifts?  
- Why is the 44-day war report being held back?

## Thoughts from the Participants
- Benyamin: Warns of heightened political turbulence as Armenia approaches the 2026 elections.
- Hovik: Notes that Arman Tatoyan has officially entered Armenian politics and flags what this could mean for the opposition landscape.
