# Summary
This Week in Review with Benyamin Poghosyan looks at Pashinyan’s escalating confrontation with the Armenian Apostolic Church, including the arrest of Archbishop Arshak Khachatryan on a narcotics “distribution” charge rooted in a 2018 incident, and the security services’ seizure of Gyumri’s Seven Wounds Church to stage a December 7 Divine Liturgy without mentioning the Catholicos. We discuss what these moves reveal about the regime’s goals toward Etchmiadzin, while polls show strong public support for both the Church and the Armed Forces. We also examine the new Armenia-EU “Strategic Agenda,” calls for Yerevan to join anti-Russia sanctions, EU funding against “Russian hybrid war,” Pashinyan’s selective publication of OSCE Minsk Group documents, and fresh polling on where Armenians see their main strategic partners and the Russian base in Gyumri.

# Main Topics Addressed

* Arrest of Archbishop Arshak Khachatryan on narcotics “distribution” charges tied to a 2018 “New Armenia, New Catholicos” break-in at Echmiadzin
* Role of the NSS, Investigative Committee, and loyal judges in turning the case into a political tool against the Church
* Seizure of Gyumri’s Seven Wounds Church for Pashinyan’s December 7 liturgy and pressure on Shirak clergy to omit the Catholicos’s name
* Broader pattern of Pashinyan’s attacks on the Church, including threats to “dethrone” the Catholicos and politicize symbols and rituals
* EU-Armenia “Strategic Agenda,” Kaja Kallas’s push for Armenia to align with EU sanctions on Russia, and new EU funding to fight “Russian hybrid war”
* Pashinyan’s selective “release” of OSCE Minsk Group and Karabakh negotiation documents after the MG’s dissolution
* Arar Foundation polling on trust in the government, Church, Armed Forces, police, and parliament, including demographic patterns
* Poll findings on preferred strategic partners (Russia, US, Iran, EU, Turkey) and attitudes toward the Russian base in Gyumri

# Key Questions Discussed

* How does a years-old allegation linked to a 2018 protest at Echmiadzin get turned into a charge of narcotics distribution against Archbishop Arshak?
* If case assignment is meant to be random, why do so many high-profile and political cases land before the same judge?
* What does the use of pretrial detention against senior clergy tell us about the state of justice and due process in Armenia?
* Why is the NSS pressuring clergy over the content of the Divine Liturgy, and why is there so little international reaction to this level of state interference?
* What is Pashinyan’s endgame in his campaign against the Armenian Church, especially when polls show it is one of the most trusted institutions in the country?
* What does the EU really expect from Armenia on sanctions and “Russian hybrid war,” and how realistic is it for Armenia to comply?
* What is the political purpose behind publishing a narrow, selective set of OSCE MG documents while omitting key items like Key West?
* How should we interpret the rise in pro-Russia sentiment in the polls and the strong support for the Russian base in Gyumri?
