## Summary

In this Conversations on Groong episode, we speak with Professor Warwick Powell about the tectonic shifts in global trade, economics, and geopolitics. From Washington's renewed tariff wars to China's expanding influence through BRICS and infrastructure initiatives like the BRI, Powell shares his insights on the emerging multipolar order and the declining dominance of the U.S.-centric financial system.

- Dollar de-weaponization and alternative financial infrastructures (e.g., BRICS Clear)
- Belt & Road Initiative vs. India’s INSTC: competition or complementarity?
- Strategic navigation for small states like Armenia in a shifting global order
