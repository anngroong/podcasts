In this episode of Conversations on Groong, we speak with Rananjay Anand, president of the Indo-Armenian Friendship NGO, about the growing potential for a strategic partnership between India and Armenia. As Turkey and Azerbaijan double down on their support for Pakistan—most recently during Operation Sindoor—Indian public sentiment is shifting. Weddings, conferences, and corporate events once destined for Istanbul and Baku are being redirected, and Armenia is emerging as a quiet alternative. We explore what’s driving this trend, the challenges posed by limited connectivity, and whether this moment could mark a turning point in India-Armenia relations.

## **Main Topics Addressed**

- Turkey and Azerbaijan's support for Pakistan during Operation Sindoor  
- Growing Indian backlash and boycotts targeting Turkish and Azerbaijani companies  
- Armenia’s potential as a strategic partner and tourist destination for Indians  
- Challenges and prospects for direct flights between India and Armenia  
- Opportunities for business, film, and hospitality cooperation between India and Armenia  

## **Key Questions Discussed**

- How did Operation Sindoor shape Indian public sentiment and foreign policy?  
- Why are Indian tourists and businesses turning away from Turkey and Azerbaijan?  
- What practical steps can Armenia take to benefit from India’s shifting preferences?  
- What’s blocking the launch of direct flights between Yerevan and Indian cities?  
- How can Indian-Armenian cooperation grow in tourism, film, and trade sectors?
