We discuss escalating tensions in the Middle East, the implications of Trump’s outreach to Iran, Azerbaijan’s stalled peace process with Armenia, and the geopolitical games being played by Turkey and Azerbaijan. We also touch upon Armenia’s delicate balancing act between Russia and the West and explore the role of the Armenian diaspora in advocating for the release of Armenian POWs held by Azerbaijan. Finally, we delve into the upcoming Gyumri municipal elections and their broader implications.
