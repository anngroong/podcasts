In this episode, former U.S. Army officer and military-political analyst Stanislav Krapivnik discusses the geopolitical fallout from the Trump-Pashinyan-Aliyev summit in Washington, which saw the announcement of a “peace” framework, the dissolution of the OSCE Minsk Group, U.S. plans for a 99-year “Trump Corridor” across Armenia, and the dropping of Section 907 to allow arms sales to Azerbaijan. He examines Russia’s heavy focus on the Ukraine war at the expense of the South Caucasus, the loss of Russian leverage over Armenia and Azerbaijan, and the growing role of Turkey. Krapivnik warns of U.S. and British designs to destabilize the region, outlines possible Russian and Iranian responses, and explores the strategic importance of Georgia, the Abkhazia railway, and regional connectivity. The conversation also delves into Armenia’s domestic political challenges, the influence of Western NGOs, and the erosion of core national institutions.
