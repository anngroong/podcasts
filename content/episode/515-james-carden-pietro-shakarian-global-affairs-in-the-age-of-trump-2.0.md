# Summary
James W.Carden and Pietro A. Shakarian assess Trump 2.0’s “Donroe Doctrine” framing as branding for coercive, deal-driven policy, then widen the lens to the collapse of “rules-based order” language and the rise of pay-to-play influence concepts like Trump’s proposed “Board of Peace.” The conversation turns to Iran, where escalating pressure, shifting demands, and regional signaling raise the risk of conflict and spillover effects for Armenia. The episode closes on JD Vance’s planned Armenia-Azerbaijan trip, how Moscow and Tehran may read it, and how corridor politics (TRIPP) and Armenia’s church-state confrontation shape the stakes.

# Main Topics Addressed
- Trump 2.0 foreign policy framing (“Donroe Doctrine”), hemispheric primacy, coercion, and transactional expansion rhetoric
- Great-power signaling and arms control after New START’s expiration
- The erosion of “rules-based order” narratives and Trump’s “Board of Peace” concept
- Iran escalation dynamics, coercive diplomacy versus pretext, and Russia-China signaling
- US domestic cohesion, enforcement politics, and structural versus personality-driven instability
- JD Vance’s Armenia-Azerbaijan visit, corridor pressure (TRIPP), and regional reactions (Russia and Iran)

# Key Questions Discussed
- What does the “Donroe Doctrine” label capture, and what does it hide?
- Is the hemisphere-first posture mainly about China, and how does it show up in policy?
- What does New START’s expiration signal, and who benefits from the leverage it creates?
- Was “rules-based order” ever more than a slogan, and what is replacing it?
- Is the “Board of Peace” a serious institution, or influence-for-sale dressed as governance?
- On Iran, are demands structured to produce a deal, or to engineer failure?
- What escalation steps are most plausible, and what could halt them?
- Is US internal turbulence a Trump spike, or an acceleration of long-running system stress?
- Why send JD Vance to Armenia and Azerbaijan now, and what message does it send to Russia and Iran?
- How do TRIPP and Armenia’s church-state confrontation shape the visit’s implications?
