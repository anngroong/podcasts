In this Week in Review episode, Groong hosts unpack a tense week in Armenian politics and society. Prime Minister Pashinyan intensifies his attacks on the Armenian Church, while the ruling Civil Contract party faces mounting criticism over corruption and nepotism. The opposition RPA nominates a symbolic candidate for prime minister amid an unlikely impeachment effort. Meanwhile, Armenia's economy shows cracks beneath reported growth, Georgia tightens trade routes, and demographic warnings grow starker as birthrates plummet and emigration continues. The episode also touches on global shifts, including the Ukraine war and Poland's presidential pivot, framing Armenia’s challenges in a broader geopolitical context.
