## **Trump Inauguration**
We recorded this episode on January 20, 2025, during Trump’s inauguration. This marks one of the most anticipated U.S. transitions of power in recent memory. Topics include:
- Potential nuclear confrontation with Russia.
- The possibility of a U.S.-Israeli strike on Iran.
- Broader shifts in the global world order.
  
Hrant shares insights on Trump's foreign policy priorities and the implications of his cabinet choices.

## **A Tale of Three Partnerships**

### **Russian-Iranian Strategic Partnership**
On January 17, Russia and Iran signed a 20-year "Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership," marking a deepening of relations. The agreement is poised to influence conflicts in Ukraine, Syria, Gaza, and Lebanon.

### **UK-Ukrainian 100-Year Partnership**
British PM Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Zelensky signed a century-long agreement on January 16, highlighting defense cooperation and NATO membership advocacy.

### **US-Armenian Strategic Partnership**
On January 14, Armenia and the U.S. signed a "Strategic Partnership" agreement, covering economic, defense, and cultural aspects. However, this move risks straining Armenia's ties with Russia and Iran.

## **"Explaining" EU to Russia**
Armenian PM Nikol Pashinyan reportedly called Vladimir Putin to clarify Armenia's alignment with the U.S. and its plans for a European Union referendum. This conversation raises questions about Armenia's delicate balancing act in the region.

## **Key questions discussed:**
- Are these agreements symbolic or transformative?
- How do they reflect shifting alliances in global geopolitics?
- How did Putin receive Pashinyan's call?
- How do Armenia’s activities sit with the Russia-Iran treaty which codified the mutual desire to prevent the interference of third parties in the South Caucasus?
