## Topics Covered
- **US Foreign Policy Under Trump** – The Trump administration's approach to reshaping U.S. foreign policy, including potential reforms or dissolution of USAID and the implications for global NGOs, particularly in Armenia.

- **US-Armenia Relations** – Examination of the US-Armenia "strategic partnership" agreement, its lack of a defense component, and its implications amid regional tensions involving Iran, Israel, and Azerbaijan.
- **Intelligence and National Security** – The role of intelligence agencies under the Trump administration, potential restructuring, and the balance between national security and government overreach.
