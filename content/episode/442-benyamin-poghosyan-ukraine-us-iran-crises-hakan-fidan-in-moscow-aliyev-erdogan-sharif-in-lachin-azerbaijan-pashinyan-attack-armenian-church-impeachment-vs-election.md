In this episode of Groong’s Week in Review, recorded on June 2, 2025, guest Benyamin Poghosyan joins hosts Hovik Manucharyan and Asbed Bedrossian to unpack a tense and volatile week in both regional and domestic politics. The conversation opens with rising tensions in the Ukraine war, as drone strikes reach deep into Russia, Germany lifts missile restrictions, and Trump labels Putin “crazy,” all while Iran nuclear talks remain frozen under hardline U.S. demands. The focus then shifts to the South Caucasus, where Turkish FM Hakan Fidan met Lavrov in Moscow to push the “3+3” platform and floated Istanbul as a summit venue for global powers. Meanwhile, Erdogan, Aliyev, and Pakistan’s PM Sharif staged a PR spectacle in Lachin to inaugurate a third airport in occupied Artsakh, signaling strategic realignments. Back in Armenia, the Pashinyans launched harsh verbal attacks on the Armenian Church just as Baku’s Grand Mufti claimed Etchmiadzin as Azerbaijani land, prompting questions of tacit coordination. The episode also revisits the impeachment debate versus opposition planning for the 2026 elections, probing whether security and corruption can drive real political traction. Finally, the hosts spotlight the rise of regime-aligned oligarch Narek Nalbandyan, whose sweetheart deals, state-enabled asset grabs, and government-backed expansion raise serious concerns about the erosion of anti-corruption values in Armenia today.

## Main Topics Addressed

- **War Drums in Ukraine and Iran**  
  Ukraine continued drone attacks deep into Russian territory, provoking harsh rhetoric from Moscow. Germany is suspected of supplying long-range Taurus missiles, and Chancellor Merz lifted range restrictions on Western weaponry. Trump called Putin “crazy” and signaled tougher measures might follow. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s attacks on Russian strategic bombers just ahead of peace talks in Istanbul raised the stakes. In parallel, US-Iran nuclear talks remain stalled, with the Trump team demanding zero enrichment and dismantling of regional alliances.

- **Hakan Fidan Visits Moscow**  
  Turkish FM Hakan Fidan met Sergey Lavrov in Moscow to discuss the “3+3” regional platform involving Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, Turkey, and Iran. Talks included unblocking transport routes, South Caucasus reconstruction, and Russia’s offer to help finalize the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace treaty. Fidan also suggested Istanbul as a summit site for Zelenskyy, Putin, Trump, and Erdogan. Notably, he endorsed Aliyev’s approach in the region as “wise,” signaling alignment with Baku’s posture.

- **Aliyev’s Airport Party in Lachin**  
  Aliyev opened yet another airport—this time in Lachin—with Turkish President Erdogan and Pakistan’s PM Sharif attending. The third such project in occupied Artsakh territory, this move was more symbolic than functional. It signaled trilateral strategic alignment and sent a pointed message to Armenia and possibly India, given Pakistan’s involvement. Corridor logistics and energy cooperation were also on the table.

- **Attacks on the Armenian Church**  
  Azerbaijan’s Grand Mufti declared Armenian religious sites like Etchmiadzin to be on “historical Azerbaijani lands.” Instead of pushing back, Armenian leaders joined in with their own attacks. Anna Hakobyan accused the clergy of pedophilia on Facebook, while Nikol Pashinyan called churches “cesspools” and insulted a bishop in deeply vulgar terms. These outbursts followed Catholicos Garegin II’s attendance at a Bern summit on Artsakh heritage, raising questions about coordination with Baku.

- **Impeachment vs. Elections in Armenia**  
  Edgar Ghazaryan renewed his call for Pashinyan’s impeachment, though it would require Civil Contract defections and lacks popular mobilization. Meanwhile, the ruling party seems to be outlining a 2026 campaign platform focused on illusory peace and temporary social welfare measures. Opposition parties remain fragmented but are testing platforms centered on national security, anti-corruption, and preserving Armenia’s sovereignty amid fears of Azerbaijani demographic influence.

- **Kitchen Sink: Russian Consulate, US Diplomacy, and Nalbandyan**  
  Armenia delays opening Russia’s consulate in Syunik despite Lavrov’s visit—yet France’s honorary consulate moved ahead smoothly. The US, via Deputy Secretary Josh Huck, warns of the “real risk” of Azerbaijani invasion while encouraging a peace treaty. Meanwhile, businessman Narek Nalbandyan’s rapid rise—from underpaying for state-seized properties to dumping cheap eggs—raises red flags on corruption under Pashinyan’s government.

## Key Questions Discussed

- Are Western arms and intelligence directly escalating the war in Ukraine?
- What are the strategic goals of Turkey and Russia in the South Caucasus?
- Why are Turkey and Pakistan aligning so visibly with Azerbaijan in Lachin?
- Is the Armenian government tacitly enabling Baku’s narrative against the Church?
- Can impeachment gain traction without public unrest or elite defections?
- What electoral strategies can the fragmented opposition realistically pursue?
- Is Armenia deliberately cooling relations with Russia over Syunik?
- What does the Nalbandyan case reveal about new oligarchs under Civil Contract?
