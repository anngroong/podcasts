# **Summary**  
This conversation with opposition leader **Hayk Mamijanyan** covers the growing pressure on free speech in Armenia, the arrests of prominent podcasters, the wider pattern of attacks on journalists, and concerns about the state of Armenia’s judiciary and law enforcement. We also discuss the Vagharshapat municipal election, reported misuse of administrative resources, the merger of electoral districts, and what these trends may signal for the June 2026 parliamentary elections. Mamijanyan outlines the opposition’s strategy for the impeachment process and its limits, while noting the silence of international actors and the risks facing independent media.
