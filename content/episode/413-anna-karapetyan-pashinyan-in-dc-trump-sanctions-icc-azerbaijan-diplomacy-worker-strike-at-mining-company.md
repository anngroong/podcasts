## Show Notes ‚Äì Episode 413  
### Pashinyan in DC, Trump Sanctions ICC, Azerbaijani Diplomacy, Workers Strike at ZCMC  

### Topics Covered  

#### **Pashinyan in DC**  
- **Purpose of the trip:**  
  - Officially for the *National Prayer Breakfast* & *International Religious Freedom (IRF) Summit*.  
  - Attempts to secure high-profile meetings, including with Trump, were unsuccessful.  
  - Only secured a brief photo-op with VP J.D. Vance.  

- **Meetings & Engagements:**  
  - Handpicked Armenian-Americans at the Armenian Embassy.  
  - Speech at the Atlantic Council, a NATO-affiliated think tank.  
  - Claims of ‚Äúprogress‚Äù in Turkey and Azerbaijan negotiations.  

- **Key Questions:**  
  - Was this trip more about optics than substance?  
  - Did Pashinyan‚Äôs presence at the IRF summit influence the removal of Artsakh‚Äôs Gegham Stepanyan from the agenda?  
  - What does ‚ÄúBalanced and Balancing‚Äù foreign policy actually mean?  
  - How does it compare to previous ‚ÄúComplementarity‚Äù policies under Kocharyan and Sargsyan?  

#### **Trump Sanctions the ICC**  
- Trump imposed sanctions on the *International Criminal Court (ICC)*.  
- Pashinyan‚Äôs administration had previously used ICC membership to justify prosecuting Aliyev for war crimes.  
- Now, Pashinyan signals willingness to withdraw Armenia‚Äôs criminal cases against Azerbaijan.  

- **Key Questions:**  
  - Did Armenia‚Äôs government always intend to drop ICC cases?  
  - Was joining the ICC more about political optics than legal action?  
  - What are the implications of Luis Moreno Ocampo‚Äôs statement that Armenia *cannot* stop ICC investigations?  

#### **Azerbaijani Diplomacy in Action**  
##### **Hajiyev in Tehran**  
- Azerbaijani official Hikmet Hajiyev visited Iran, likely pushing for the *Zangezur Corridor*.  
- Iran reaffirmed its strong opposition, calling the corridor ‚Äúdetrimental‚Äù to both Armenia and Iran.  
- **Key Questions:**  
  - Why does Azerbaijan insist on this corridor despite simpler alternatives?  
  - What does Iran‚Äôs response mean for regional stability?  

##### **Aliyev Ramps Up AZAL Rhetoric**  
- Tensions between Russia & Azerbaijan escalate over the downing of an Azerbaijani AZAL aircraft.  
- Baku expels Russia‚Äôs *Rossotrudnichestvo* cultural center, labeling it an intelligence front.  
- Azerbaijan also tightens visa restrictions for Russian citizens.  

- **Key Questions:**  
  - Is Aliyev seeking leverage over Putin in exchange for concessions on Armenia?  
  - Are these diplomatic moves a precursor to further Azerbaijani military actions?  

#### **Workers Strike at the ZCMC**  
- A 10-day strike at *Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine (ZCMC)*, Armenia‚Äôs largest taxpayer.  
- 78% owned by Russian billionaire *Roman Trotsenko*, 22% by the Armenian government.  
- The government‚Äôs **passive stance** raises questions about its political motives.  

- **Key Questions:**  
  - Why hasn‚Äôt the Armenian government intervened?  
  - Are there deeper geopolitical reasons behind the strike?

### **Thoughts from the Participants**  
- **Hovik:**  
  - Gratitude for **Catholicos Aram I**‚Äôs letter to Trump urging action on POWs.  
  - Concerns over handpicked diaspora Armenians attending Pashinyan‚Äôs meetings while he downplays genocide and criticizes diaspora institutions.  
- **Anna:**  
  - The alarming normalization of Pashinyan‚Äôs rhetoric on Armenia‚Äôs identity and genocide denial.  
  - Lack of strong national resistance to his government‚Äôs agenda.
