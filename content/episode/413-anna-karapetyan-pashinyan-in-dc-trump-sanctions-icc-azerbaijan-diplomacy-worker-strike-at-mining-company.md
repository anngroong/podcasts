## **Main Topics Addressed**  

### **Pashinyan in DC**  
- Pashinyan’s trip to Washington was more about securing a photo op with U.S. officials than achieving concrete outcomes.  
- His speech at the Atlantic Council and the meeting with Armenian-Americans in Washington.  
- Pashinyan’s new discourse about Armenia's future development and relations with the diaspora.  

### **Trump Sanctions the ICC**  
- Trump sanctioned the International Criminal Court (ICC), which Armenia had joined in the hopes of prosecuting Aliyev.  
- Armenia’s willingness to withdraw criminal cases against Azerbaijan upon a peace agreement.  
- Luis Moreno Ocampo's backlash on Armenia's stance regarding ICC investigations into crimes against Armenians.  

### **Azerbaijani Diplomacy in Action**  
- Hikmet Hajiyev’s visit to Tehran, with the focus on the Zangezur Corridor and Iran’s opposition to it.  
- Azerbaijan expelling Russia's *Rossotrudnichestvo* and escalating tensions with Russia.  
- Armenia’s role in navigating tensions between Azerbaijan, Iran, and Russia.  

### **Workers Strike at the ZCMC**  
- Workers at Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Compound (ZCMC) went on strike, and the government took a passive stance.  
- The geopolitical context of ZCMC’s ownership and its role in Armenia’s economy.  

---

## **Key Questions Discussed**  

### **Pashinyan in DC**  
- What was the real purpose behind Pashinyan’s trip? Was it about securing a high-level meeting with U.S. officials, or just for optics?  
- Why was the photo-op with J.D. Vance so important for Pashinyan’s government?  
- What does Pashinyan mean by a “balanced and balancing” foreign policy? Is it a departure from previous foreign policy strategies?  
- Did Pashinyan’s government make any significant progress with Turkey and Azerbaijan during his visit?  

### **Trump Sanctions the ICC**  
- Why did Armenia join the ICC if it knew it would eventually withdraw its cases against Azerbaijan?  
- Was Armenia’s membership to the ICC more about political leverage than legal action?  
- Can Armenia stop ICC investigations into crimes against Armenians, and what are the long-term consequences of withdrawing cases?  

### **Azerbaijani Diplomacy in Action**  
- Why is Azerbaijan so insistent on the Zangezur Corridor, despite Iran’s strong opposition?  
- How can Armenia balance its relations with Azerbaijan, Iran, and Russia given the geopolitical context?  
- What does Azerbaijan's expulsion of Russia's cultural center and its tightened visa restrictions signify for regional diplomacy?  

### **Workers Strike at the ZCMC**  
- Why has the Armenian government taken such a passive stance towards the workers’ strike? Could there be a political motive?  
- What does the ZCMC strike mean for Armenia’s economy, especially with its large tax revenue contribution?

## **Thoughts from the Participants**  

### **Hovik**  
- Gratitude for Catholicos Aram I’s leadership and letter to Trump urging immediate action on Armenian POWs.  
- The hypocrisy of diaspora Armenians attending Pashinyan’s meetings while he denies genocide and criticizes diaspora institutions.  

### **Anna**  
- The lack of real national resistance to Pashinyan’s policies, including his rhetoric on Armenia’s identity and genocide denial.  
- The increasing acceptance of Pashinyan's agenda within Armenian society despite its contradictions with Armenian history.
