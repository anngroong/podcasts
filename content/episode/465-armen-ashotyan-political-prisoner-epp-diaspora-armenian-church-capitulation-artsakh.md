In this episode of *Conversations on Groong*, we speak with **Armen Ashotyan**, vice president of the Republican Party of Armenia, in his first English-language interview since being released from house arrest. Ashotyan reflects on his 25 months of detention as Armenia’s most prominent political prisoner, the broader pattern of repression under Pashinyan, the muted response of Western diplomats, the fragmented stance of the diaspora, and the ongoing erosion of Armenian statehood through the so-called “peace” process with Azerbaijan.  

---

# Main Topics Addressed
- Armen Ashotyan’s imprisonment, conditions of detention, and current restrictions.  
- The role and response of international organizations and the Armenian diaspora.
- The Pashinyan government’s targeting of the Armenian Church and broader political repression.  
- The “Managed Capitulation Process”: Artsakh’s ethnic cleansing, the 17-point draft document, and constitutional preconditions.  

---

# Key Questions Discussed
- What was Ashotyan’s experience as a political prisoner under the Pashinyan regime?  
- How has international and diaspora support compared to earlier eras?  
- Why are Church leaders and activists being imprisoned, and why is society tolerating it?  
- How does Ashotyan assess Pashinyan’s handling of negotiations with Aliyev and the so-called “peace” process?  
- What does the 17-point draft document mean for Armenia, and how realistic is constitutional change as a precondition?
