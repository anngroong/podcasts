## Summary

In this Week in Review episode, we unpack the latest geopolitical maneuvers affecting Armenia—from the proposed Zangezur Corridor lease floated by the U.S., to the Trump ultimatum for a Ukraine ceasefire. We also examine the fallout from Azerbaijan’s decision to revoke ICRC access to Armenian POWs, and discuss the rising number of political prisoners inside Armenia itself. With regional tensions rising and domestic pressure mounting, is Armenia being squeezed from all sides?
