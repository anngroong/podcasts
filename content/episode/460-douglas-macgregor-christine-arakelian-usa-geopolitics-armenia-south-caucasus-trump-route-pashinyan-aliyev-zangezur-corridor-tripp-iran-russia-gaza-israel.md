**Summary**  
In this episode, Christine Arakelian and Col. Douglas MacGregor join the hosts to analyze U.S. foreign policy moves from Gaza to the South Caucasus. They discuss Israel’s ongoing campaign in Gaza, the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran, and the likely resumption of hostilities. The conversation examines the Trump–Pashinyan–Aliyev White House summit, the strategic “Trump Corridor” across Armenia, and its impact on Russia, Iran, and India. The guests explore India–Armenia relations, U.S. economic vulnerabilities, and the challenges of sustaining a long-term American role in the region. They also assess the risks and potential outcomes of the upcoming Trump–Putin summit in Alaska, and the Armenian government’s handling of sovereignty, diaspora relations, and political prisoners.  

## Main Topics Addressed
- U.S. involvement in Gaza and Israeli policy objectives.  
- The Iran conflict, ceasefire dynamics, and likely resumption.  
- Russia–Iran strategic ties, BRICS, and the INSTC.  
- The Trump–Pashinyan–Aliyev summit and “Trump Corridor” deal.  
- Strategic implications for Russia, Iran, and India.  
- India–Armenia relations in the regional context.  
- Risks and opportunities from the Trump–Putin Alaska summit.  
- U.S. debt, industrial decline, and limited capacity for Eurasian commitments.  
- Armenia’s sovereignty issues, diaspora engagement, and political prisoner cases.  

## Key Questions Discussed

- Is the Iran conflict truly over?  
- Will Russia stay on the sidelines if Iran is attacked again?  
- Who benefits from the “Trump Corridor” and why is the U.S. pursuing it?  
- How could control of an Armenian corridor affect Russia, Iran, and India’s transport networks?  
- How important is India to Armenia and vice versa?
