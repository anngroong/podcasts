## Summary

In this Conversations on Groong episode, Dr. Arthur Khachikyan discusses the rapid erosion of free expression in Armenia after the arrest of Imnemnimi podcasters Vazgen Saghatelyan and Narek Samsonyan. The conversation traces how a personal insult case against Speaker Alen Simonyan turned into an NSS raid on the AntiFake / Imnemnimi studio, pretrial detention for four staff, and the seizure of all production equipment. Khachikyan places this case in a wider pattern of pressure on journalists, lawyers, priests, and political scientists, and stresses how Western silence and double standards enable this crackdown. The episode ends with a call to Armenian and international audiences to use what remains of their freedom to expose this campaign and defend what is left of Armenia’s democracy.

# Main Topics Addressed

- Arrest and pretrial detention of Imnemnimi hosts Vazgen Saghatelyan and Narek Samsonyan, and the NSS raid on their studio.
- Confiscation of all production equipment from AntiFake / Imnemnimi, including cameras, lights, microphones, and computers.
- Use of “hooliganism” charges as a new tool to punish political speech after earlier insult and hate speech bills met resistance.
- A wider system of intimidation against journalists, lawyers, priests, and political scientists who criticize the authorities.
- The collapse of political culture in Armenia, including public spitting incidents and coarse language at the highest levels of power.
- Western double standards on human rights, comparing reactions to Kosovo, Gaza, and Syria with silence on the ethnic cleansing of Armenians.
- The role of Western governments, embassies, and NGOs in enabling Armenia’s leadership through selective concern and inaction.
- A call for independent media, diaspora communities, and listeners to expose the Imnemnimi case and the broader campaign against free speech.

# Key Questions Discussed

- How did a verbal clash with the Speaker of Parliament lead to a national security raid, mass equipment seizure, and pretrial detention for podcasters?
- What does the seizure of cameras, microphones, computers, and even tripods say about the state’s real goals toward independent media?
- In what ways has the “hooliganism” article become a replacement for insult and hate speech laws that failed to pass?
- How does the treatment of Imnemnimi fit into a wider pattern of arrests and pressure against lawyers, priests, and political opponents?
- Why are Western embassies and human rights organizations silent when Armenian authorities use methods that would not be accepted in their own countries?
- What do comparisons with Kosovo, Gaza, Syria, and the 2018 “Velvet Revolution” reveal about Western interests and double standards?
- What can independent journalists, diaspora Armenians, and ordinary listeners do to bring attention to this crackdown and defend what remains of Armenia’s democracy?
