In this Week in Review, we examine Armenia’s mounting strategic, political, and economic pressures. The discussion focuses on Pashinyan’s dual-track signaling toward the EU and Russia, rising tensions with the Armenian Apostolic Church, renewed controversies around Artsakh and the right of return, NSS raids on Artsakh institutions in Yerevan, and troubling indicators from Armenia’s 2025 economic performance, including declining trade, underexecuted capital spending, and rising state debt.

---

## Main Topics Addressed

### Armenia Between the West and Russia

* Pashinyan’s official visit to Germany followed by a working visit to Russia for the EAEU Intergovernmental Council
* Western framing of peace, EU alignment, and transport corridors as a single package
* Public signaling toward EU membership while remaining inside the EAEU
* Russia’s growing unease over Armenia’s strategic ambiguity

### EU Engagement and Informal Pressure

* Pashinyan’s statement that EU membership is a goal, even if leaving the EAEU is not
* Ararat Mirzoyan’s informal participation in the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels
* Reports that Armenia’s 2026 parliamentary elections were discussed during an informal EU breakfast
* Questions around EU expectations, including sanctions on Russia

### Church–State Confrontation

* Pashinyan’s shifting justifications for confronting the Armenian Apostolic Church
* Proposal for Catholicos Garegin II’s resignation and appointment of a caretaker vicar
* Government-driven canon law reform, clergy vetting, and political restrictions
* Constitutional implications of state interference in church affairs

### Artsakh, Concessions, and Right of Return

* Post-2020 and post-2023 concessions culminating in the loss of Artsakh
* Azerbaijan’s demand for the “return” of 1990s Azerbaijani refugees to Armenia
* Armenia’s effective closure of the Artsakh Armenians’ right of return
* Pashinyan’s proposal to drop Artsakh return claims in exchange for Azerbaijan abandoning the “Western Azerbaijan” narrative

### NSS Raids on Artsakh Institutions

* Raids on Artsakh offices in Yerevan without detailed public justification
* Timing coinciding with renewed advocacy for Artsakh Armenians’ rights
* Broader concerns about rule of law and political pressure

### Armenia’s Economy in 2025

* Sharp decline in trade and reexports with Russia
* Severe underperformance in capital expenditures, including defense, schools, roads, and infrastructure
* Rising state debt exceeding $14 billion
* Weak execution across multiple strategic development programs

---

## Key Questions Discussed

* Can Armenia realistically pursue EU membership while remaining in the EAEU?
* What does the EU expect from Armenia in return for political and electoral support?
* Are sanctions on Russia under serious consideration in Yerevan?
* What constitutional limits exist on government intervention in church affairs?
* Can the rights of displaced Artsakh Armenians be negotiated away?
* Do NSS raids signal a breakdown in rule of law?
* Why are economic failures and rising debt not central to political debate ahead of elections?

---

## Thoughts from the Participants

* **Arthur Khachatryan:** Structural weaknesses of the opposition and the cult-like dynamics of Pashinyan’s political system.
* **Hovik Manucharyan:** Reflections on Mikayel Minasyan’s recent Facebook post and its broader political implications.
