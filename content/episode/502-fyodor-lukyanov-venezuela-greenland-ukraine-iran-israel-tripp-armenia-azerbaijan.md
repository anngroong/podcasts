# Summary
Fyodor Lukyanov joins Groong to discuss how Moscow reads a fast-shifting global landscape, from the U.S. raid in Venezuela and maritime seizures at sea, to Trump’s Greenland rhetoric, the stalled endgame in Ukraine, the likelihood of a renewed Israel-Iran war, and how TRIPP and “unblocking” disputes in Armenia’s south fit into Russia’s regional priorities.

# Main Topics Addressed
- Venezuela, U.S. power projection, and what Russia can (and cannot) do in response
- Greenland and U.S. territorial rhetoric, viewed from Moscow
- Ukraine war endgame, Europe’s posture, and Russia-West negotiations
- Russia-Iran relations after the June 2025 Israel-Iran war, and prospects of a second round
- TRIPP, “Zangezur Corridor,” Nov. 2020 point 9, and Russia’s expectations in Armenia’s south
- Armenia’s June elections and foreign influence narratives

# Key Questions Discussed

## Venezuela
- What is Russia’s perspective on the U.S. abduction of Nicolás Maduro?
- How does Moscow interpret “our hemisphere” thinking and open U.S. coercion?
- What is Russia’s reaction to U.S. and UK-backed seizures of Russian-flagged tankers at sea?
- Are there parallels between U.S. claims in the Americas and Russia’s position on Ukraine?

## Greenland
- Does Moscow see Trump’s Greenland rhetoric as serious, or as political theater?
- Does Greenland matter to Russia’s Arctic security calculus?

## Ukraine war
- Why is the war still going on as it approaches year four?
- Where do Russia-West negotiations stand right now?
- Does Putin see Trump as negotiating in good faith?
- What would “closure” actually require, and what are the realistic off-ramps?
- Has the war made Russia more dependent on China, and did it open space for the West in places like the South Caucasus and Central Asia?

## Russia and Iran
- Is a second Israel-Iran war inevitable, and is Iran more prepared this time?
- Has the Venezuela episode changed Russia’s calculus on how far it should go to help Iran?
- If Russia will not intervene militarily, what non-military tools does it still have?

## TRIPP and Russian-Armenian relations
- What does Russia expect regarding east-west “unblocking” in Armenia’s south and the wider “Middle Corridor” debate?
- Why might Russia be re-engaging in the South Caucasus now?
- How important is the Armenia-Iran border and the north-south corridor to Russia’s interests?
- Does TRIPP risk inserting U.S. or Israeli assets near Iran, and does Moscow view that as a strategic problem?
- How does Russia view disputes around Russian Railways and Armenia’s rail concession?

## Armenian elections
- Does the outcome of Armenia’s June elections matter to Russia?
- How does Russia view EU-funded programs framed as countering “foreign influence,” especially “Russian influence”?
- Is Pashinyan’s administration still a workable partner for Moscow?
