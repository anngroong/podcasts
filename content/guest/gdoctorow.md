__Dr. Gilbert Doctorow__ holds a Ph.D. in Russian history from Columbia University and is a fluent Russian speaker. He spent most of his professional life in corporate business with a focus on Russia. Doctorow has authored five books of essays. He also has participated in expert forums devoted to international affairs and appeared in Russian domestic political talk shows on all national channels.
His latest book, the newly published "Memoirs of a Russianist, Volume I" directs attention to two periods of his business career when his perch afforded him a rare opportunity to observe and interact with the people and institutions shaping economic, cultural and social life in Russia, 1976-80 and 1989-2000. In the first period he was a consultant taking senior executives from some of Americaâ€™s best known corporations to negotiations in Moscow with Soviet end-users over turnkey manufacturing projects. In the second period he was the corporate executive planning and running ongoing operations, including as expatriate general manager on the ground. The book will be useful to business school students and those embarking on careers in Emerging Markets, where the challenges of maintaining one's footing can be formidable and where the fastest moving objects in FMCG companies may be the managers themselves. Available from Amazon.com and other leading online retailers.
